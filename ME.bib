	abstract = {blaNDM genes confer carbapenem resistance and have been identified on transferable plasmids belonging to different incompatibility (Inc) groups. Here we present the complete sequences of four plasmids carrying a blaNDM gene, pKP1-NDM-1, pEC2-NDM-3, pECL3-NDM-1, and pEC4-NDM-6, from four clinical samples originating from four different patients. Different plasmids carry segments that align to different parts of the blaNDM region found on Acinetobacter plasmids. pKP1-NDM-1 and pEC2-NDM-3, from Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, respectively, were identified as type 1 IncA/C2 plasmids with almost identical backbones. Different regions carrying blaNDM are inserted in different locations in the antibiotic resistance island known as ARI-A, and ISCR1 may have been involved in the acquisition of blaNDM-3 by pEC2-NDM-3. pECL3-NDM-1 and pEC4-NDM-6, from Enterobacter cloacae and E. coli, respectively, have similar IncFIIY backbones, but different regions carrying blaNDM are found in different locations. Tn3-derived inverted-repeat transposable elements (TIME) appear to have been involved in the acquisition of blaNDM-6 by pEC4-NDM-6 and the rmtC 16S rRNA methylase gene by IncFIIY plasmids. Characterization of these plasmids further demonstrates that even very closely related plasmids may have acquired blaNDM genes by different mechanisms. These findings also illustrate the complex relationships between antimicrobial resistance genes, transposable elements, and plasmids and provide insights into the possible routes for transmission of blaNDM genes among species of the Enterobacteriaceae family.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Visualisation of genome comparisons is invaluable for helping to determine genotypic differences between closely related prokaryotes. New visualisation and abstraction methods are required in order to improve the validation, interpretation and communication of genome sequence information; especially with the increasing amount of data arising from next-generation sequencing projects. Visualising a prokaryote genome as a circular image has become a powerful means of displaying informative comparisons of one genome to a number of others. Several programs, imaging libraries and internet resources already exist for this purpose, however, most are either limited in the number of comparisons they can show, are unable to adequately utilise draft genome sequence data, or require a knowledge of command-line scripting for implementation. Currently, there is no freely available desktop application that enables users to rapidly visualise comparisons between hundreds of draft or complete genomes in a single image.
RESULTS: BLAST Ring Image Generator (BRIG) can generate images that show multiple prokaryote genome comparisons, without an arbitrary limit on the number of genomes compared. The output image shows similarity between a central reference sequence and other sequences as a set of concentric rings, where BLAST matches are coloured on a sliding scale indicating a defined percentage identity. Images can also include draft genome assembly information to show read coverage, assembly breakpoints and collapsed repeats. In addition, BRIG supports the mapping of unassembled sequencing reads against one or more central reference sequences. Many types of custom data and annotations can be shown using BRIG, making it a versatile approach for visualising a range of genomic comparison data. BRIG is readily accessible to any user, as it assumes no specialist computational knowledge and will perform all required file parsing and BLAST comparisons automatically.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a clear need for a user-friendly program that can produce genome comparisons for a large number of prokaryote genomes with an emphasis on rapidly utilising unfinished or unassembled genome data. Here we present BRIG, a cross-platform application that enables the interactive generation of comparative genomic images via a simple graphical-user interface. BRIG is freely available for all operating systems at http://sourceforge.net/projects/brig/.},

	abstract = {Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common infectious diseases of humans, with Escherichia coli responsible for {\textgreater}80\% of all cases. One extreme of UTI is asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU), which occurs as an asymptomatic carrier state that resembles commensalism. To understand the evolution and molecular mechanisms that underpin ABU, the genome of the ABU E. coli strain VR50 was sequenced. Analysis of the complete genome indicated that it most resembles E. coli K-12, with the addition of a 94-kb genomic island (GI-VR50-pheV), eight prophages, and multiple plasmids. GI-VR50-pheV has a mosaic structure and contains genes encoding a number of UTI-associated virulence factors, namely, Afa (afimbrial adhesin), two autotransporter proteins (Ag43 and Sat), and aerobactin. We demonstrated that the presence of this island in VR50 confers its ability to colonize the murine bladder, as a VR50 mutant with GI-VR50-pheV deleted was attenuated in a mouse model of UTI in vivo. We established that Afa is the island-encoded factor responsible for this phenotype using two independent deletion (Afa operon and AfaE adhesin) mutants. E. coli VR50afa and VR50afaE displayed significantly decreased ability to adhere to human bladder epithelial cells. In the mouse model of UTI, VR50afa and VR50afaE displayed reduced bladder colonization compared to wild-type VR50, similar to the colonization level of the GI-VR50-pheV mutant. Our study suggests that E. coli VR50 is a commensal-like strain that has acquired fitness factors that facilitate colonization of the human bladder.},

	abstract = {Multi-country outbreaks of foodborne bacterial disease present challenges in their detection, tracking, and notification. As food is increasingly distributed across borders, such outbreaks are becoming more common. This increases the need for high-resolution, accessible, and replicable isolate typing schemes. Here we evaluate a core genome multilocus typing (cgMLST) scheme for the high-resolution reproducible typing of Salmonella enterica (S. enterica) isolates, by its application to a large European outbreak of S. enterica serovar Enteritidis. This outbreak had been extensively characterised using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based approaches. The cgMLST analysis was congruent with the original SNP-based analysis, the epidemiological data, and whole genome MLST (wgMLST) analysis. Combination of the cgMLST and epidemiological data confirmed that the genetic diversity among the isolates predated the outbreak, and was likely present at the infection source. There was consequently no link between country of isolation and genetic diversity, but the cgMLST clusters were congruent with date of isolation. Furthermore, comparison with publicly available Enteritidis isolate data demonstrated that the cgMLST scheme presented is highly scalable, enabling outbreaks to be contextualised within the Salmonella genus. The cgMLST scheme is therefore shown to be a standardised and scalable typing method, which allows Salmonella outbreaks to be analysed and compared across laboratories and jurisdictions.},

	abstract = {For many decades, Salmonella enterica has been subdivided by serological properties into serovars or further subdivided for epidemiological tracing by a variety of diagnostic tests with higher resolution. Recently, it has been proposed that so-called eBurst groups (eBGs) based on the alleles of seven housekeeping genes (legacy multilocus sequence typing [MLST]) corresponded to natural populations and could replace serotyping. However, this approach lacks the resolution needed for epidemiological tracing and the existence of natural populations had not been independently validated by independent criteria. Here, we describe EnteroBase, a web-based platform that assembles draft genomes from Illumina short reads in the public domain or that are uploaded by users. EnteroBase implements legacy MLST as well as ribosomal gene MLST (rMLST), core genome MLST (cgMLST), and whole genome MLST (wgMLST) and currently contains over 100,000 assembled genomes from Salmonella. It also provides graphical tools for visual interrogation of these genotypes and those based on core single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). eBGs based on legacy MLST are largely consistent with eBGs based on rMLST, thus demonstrating that these correspond to natural populations. rMLST also facilitated the selection of representative genotypes for SNP analyses of the entire breadth of diversity within Salmonella. In contrast, cgMLST provides the resolution needed for epidemiological investigations. These observations show that genomic genotyping, with the assistance of EnteroBase, can be applied at all levels of diversity within the Salmonella genus.},

            Background
            National epidemic dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infections are being driven by: the degree of recent indoor mixing (both social and workplace), vaccine coverage, intrinsic properties of the circulating lineages, and prior history of infection (via natural immunity). In England, infections, hospitalisations and deaths fell during the first two steps of the “roadmap” for exiting the third national lockdown. The third step of the roadmap in England takes place on 17 May 2021.
          
          
            Methods
            We report the most recent findings on community infections from the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study in which a swab is obtained from a representative cross-sectional sample of the population in England and tested using PCR. Round 11 of REACT-1 commenced self-administered swab-collection on 15 April 2021 and completed collections on 3 May 2021. We compare the results of REACT-1 round 11 to round 10, in which swabs were collected from 11 to 30 March 2021.
          
          
            Results
            Between rounds 10 and 11, prevalence of swab-positivity dropped by 50\% in England from 0.20\% (0.17\%, 0.23\%) to 0.10\% (0.08\%, 0.13\%), with a corresponding R estimate of 0.90 (0.87, 0.94). Rates of swab-positivity fell in the 55 to 64 year old group from 0.17\% (0.12\%, 0.25\%) in round 10 to 0.06\% (0.04\%, 0.11\%) in round 11. Prevalence in round 11 was higher in the 25 to 34 year old group at 0.21\% (0.12\%, 0.38\%) than in the 55 to 64 year olds and also higher in participants of Asian ethnicity at 0.31\% (0.16\%, 0.60\%) compared with white participants at 0.09\% (0.07\%, 0.11\%). Based on sequence data for positive samples for which a lineage could be identified, we estimate that 92.3\% (75.9\%, 97.9\%, n=24) of infections were from the B.1.1.7 lineage compared to 7.7\% (2.1\%, 24.1\%, n=2) from the B.1.617.2 lineage. Both samples from the B.1.617.2 lineage were detected in London from participants not reporting travel in the previous two weeks. Also, allowing for suitable lag periods, the prior close alignment between prevalence of infections and hospitalisations and deaths nationally has diverged.
          
          
            Discussion
            We observed marked reductions in prevalence from March to April and early May 2021 in England reflecting the success of the vaccination programme and despite easing of restrictions during lockdown. However, there is potential upwards pressure on prevalence from the further easing of lockdown regulations and presence of the B.1.617.2 lineage. If prevalence rises in the coming weeks, policy-makers will need to assess the possible impact on hospitalisations and deaths. In addition, consideration should be given to other health and economic impacts if increased levels of community transmission occur.},

CoronaHiT uses transposase-based library preparation of ARTIC PCR products. Method performance was demonstrated by sequencing 2 plates containing 95 and 59 SARS-CoV-2 genomes on nanopore and Illumina platforms and comparing to the ARTIC LoCost nanopore method. Of the 154 samples sequenced using all 3 methods, ≥ 90\% genome coverage was obtained for 64.3\% using ARTIC LoCost, 71.4\% using CoronaHiT-ONT and 76.6\% using CoronaHiT-Illumina, with almost identical clustering on a maximum likelihood tree. This protocol will aid the rapid expansion of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing globally.},

            Background
            England entered a third national lockdown from 6 January 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite a successful vaccine rollout during the first half of 2021, cases and hospitalisations have started to increase since the end of May as the SARS-CoV-2 Delta (B.1.617.2) variant increases in frequency. The final step of relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions in England has been delayed from 21 June to 19 July 2021.
          
          
            Methods
            The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmision-1 (REACT-1) study measures the prevalence of swab-positivity among random samples of the population of England. Round 12 of REACT-1 obtained self-administered swab collections from participants from 20 May 2021 to 7 June 2021; results are compared with those for round 11, in which swabs were collected from 15 April to 3 May 2021.
          
          
            Results
            Between rounds 11 and 12, national prevalence increased from 0.10\% (0.08\%, 0.13\%) to 0.15\% (0.12\%, 0.18\%). During round 12, we detected exponential growth with a doubling time of 11 (7.1, 23) days and an R number of 1.44 (1.20, 1.73). The highest prevalence was found in the North West at 0.26\% (0.16\%, 0.41\%) compared to 0.05\% (0.02\%, 0.12\%) in the South West. In the North West, the locations of positive samples suggested a cluster in Greater Manchester and the east Lancashire area. Prevalence in those aged 5-49 was 2.5 times higher at 0.20\% (0.16\%, 0.26\%) compared with those aged 50 years and above at 0.08\% (0.06\%, 0.11\%). At the beginning of February 2021, the link between infection rates and hospitalisations and deaths started to weaken, although in late April 2021, infection rates and hospital admissions started to reconverge. When split by age, the weakened link between infection rates and hospitalisations at ages 65 years and above was maintained, while the trends converged below the age of 65 years. The majority of the infections in the younger group occurred in the unvaccinated population or those without a stated vaccine history. We observed the rapid replacement of the Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant of SARS-CoV-2 with the Delta variant during the period covered by rounds 11 and 12 of the study.
          
          
            Discussion
            The extent to which exponential growth continues, or slows down as a consequence of the continued rapid roll-out of the vaccination programme, including to young adults, requires close monitoring. Data on community prevalence are vital to track the course of the epidemic and inform ongoing decisions about the timing of further lifting of restrictions in England.},

            Background
            
              Shiga toxigenic
              Escherichia coli
              (STEC) is an emerging global pathogen and remains a major cause of food-borne illness with more severe symptoms including hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Since the characterization of the archetypal STEC serotype,
              E. coli
              O157:H7, more than 250 STEC serotypes have been defined. Many of these non-O157 STEC are associated with clinical cases of equal severity as O157. In this study, we utilize whole genome sequencing of 44 STEC strains from eight serogroups associated with human infection to establish their evolutionary relationships and contrast this with their virulence gene profiles and established typing methods.
            
          
          
            Results
            
              Our phylogenomic analysis delineated these STEC strains into seven distinct lineages, each with a characteristic repertoire of virulence factors. Some lineages included commensal or other
              E. coli
              pathotypes. Multiple independent acquisitions of the Locus for Enterocyte Effacement were identified, each associated with a distinct repertoire of effector genes. Lineages were inconsistent with O-antigen typing in several instances, consistent with lateral gene transfer within the O-antigen locus. STEC lineages could be defined by the conservation of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs), however, no CRISPR profile could differentiate STEC from other
              E. coli
              strains. Six genomic regions (ranging from 500 bp - 10 kbp) were found to be conserved across all STEC in this dataset and may dictate interactions with Stx phage lysogeny.
            
          
          
            Conclusions
            
              The genomic analyses reported here present non-O157 STEC as a diverse group of pathogenic
              E. coli
              emerging from multiple lineages that independently acquired mobile genetic elements that promote pathogenesis.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly throughout the world. In the UK, the initial peak was in April 2020; in the county of Norfolk (UK) and surrounding areas, which has a stable, low-density population, over 3200 cases were reported between March and August 2020. As part of the activities of the national COVID-19 Genomics Consortium (COG-UK) we undertook whole genome sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes present in positive clinical samples from the Norfolk region. These samples were collected by four major hospitals, multiple minor hospitals, care facilities and community organizations within Norfolk and surrounding areas. We combined clinical metadata with the sequencing data from regional SARS-CoV-2 genomes to understand the origins, genetic variation, transmission and expansion (spread) of the virus within the region and provide context nationally. Data were fed back into the national effort for pandemic management, whilst simultaneously being used to assist local outbreak analyses. Overall, 1565 positive samples (172 per 100 000 population) from 1376 cases were evaluated; for 140 cases between two and six samples were available providing longitudinal data. This represented 42.6 \% of all positive samples identified by hospital testing in the region and encompassed those with clinical need, and health and care workers and their families. In total, 1035 cases had genome sequences of sufficient quality to provide phylogenetic lineages. These genomes belonged to 26 distinct global lineages, indicating that there were multiple separate introductions into the region. Furthermore, 100 genetically distinct UK lineages were detected demonstrating local evolution, at a rate of {\textasciitilde}2 SNPs per month, and multiple co-occurring lineages as the pandemic progressed. Our analysis: identified a discrete sublineage associated with six care facilities; found no evidence of reinfection in longitudinal samples; ruled out a nosocomial outbreak; identified 16 lineages in key workers which were not in patients, indicating infection control measures were effective; and found the D614G spike protein mutation which is linked to increased transmissibility dominates the samples and rapidly confirmed relatedness of cases in an outbreak at a food processing facility. The large-scale genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2-positive samples has provided valuable additional data for public health epidemiology in the Norfolk region, and will continue to help identify and untangle hidden transmission chains as the pandemic evolves.},

              Escherichia coli
              from ten chickens and nine guinea fowl in rural Gambia. After Illumina whole-genome sequencing, 28 sequence types were detected in the isolates (four of them novel), of which ST155 was the most common (22/68, 32\%). These strains span four of the eight main phylogroups of
              E. coli
              , with phylogroups B1 and A being most prevalent. Nearly a third of the isolates harboured at least one antimicrobial resistance gene, while most of the ST155 isolates (14/22, 64\%) encoded resistance to ≥3 classes of clinically relevant antibiotics, as well as putative virulence factors, suggesting pathogenic potential in humans. Furthermore, hierarchical clustering revealed that several Gambian poultry strains were closely related to isolates from humans. Although the ST155 lineage is common in poultry from Africa and South America, the Gambian ST155 isolates sit within a tight genomic cluster (100 alleles difference) of strains from poultry and livestock in sub-Saharan Africa (the Gambia, Uganda and Kenya). Continued surveillance of
              E. coli
              and other potential pathogens in rural backyard poultry from sub-Saharan Africa is warranted.},

            Spoligotyping of

            provides a subspecies classification of this major human pathogen. Spoligotypes can be predicted from short read genome sequencing data; however, no methods exist for long read sequence data such as from Nanopore or PacBio. We present a novel software package Galru, which can rapidly detect the spoligotype of a
            Mycobacterium tuberculosis

              Escherichia coli
              in healthy children from sub-Saharan Africa, even though this is pertinent to understanding bacterial evolution and ecology and their role in infection. We isolated and whole-genome sequenced up to five colonies of faecal
              E. coli
              from 66 asymptomatic children aged three-to-five years in rural Gambia (n = 88 isolates from 21 positive stools). We identified 56 genotypes, with an average of 2.7 genotypes per host. These were spread over 37 seven-allele sequence types and the
              E. coli
              phylogroups A, B1, B2, C, D, E, F and
              Escherichia
              cryptic clade I. Immigration events accounted for three-quarters of the diversity within our study population, while one-quarter of variants appeared to have arisen from within-host evolution. Several isolates encode putative virulence factors commonly found in Enteropathogenic and Enteroaggregative
              E. coli,
              and 53\% of the isolates encode resistance to three or more classes of antimicrobials. Thus, resident
              E. coli
              in these children may constitute reservoirs of virulence- and resistance-associated genes. Moreover, several study strains were closely related to isolates that caused disease in humans or originated from livestock. Our results suggest that within-host evolution plays a minor role in the generation of diversity compared to independent immigration and the establishment of strains among our study population. Also, this study adds significantly to the number of commensal
              E. coli
              genomes, a group that has been traditionally underrepresented in the sequencing of this species.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Background
            The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues to expand globally, with case numbers rising in many areas of the world, including the Indian sub-continent. Pakistan has one of the world ‘s largest population, of over 200 million people and is experiencing a severe third wave of infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 that begun in March 2021.In Pakistan, during third wave until now only 12 SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been collected and among these 9 are from Islamabad. This highlights the need for more genome sequencing to allow surveillance of variants in circulation. In fact more genomes are available among travellers with a travel history from Pakistan, than from within the country itself.
          
          
            Methods
            For a better understanding of the circulating variants in Lahore and surrounding areas with a combined population of 11.1 million, within a week of April 2021, 102 samples were sequenced. The samples were randomly collected from 2 hospitals with a diagnostic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cutoff value of less than 25 cycles.
          
          
            Results
            Analysis of the lineages shows that B.1.1.7 (first identified in the UK, Alpha variant) dominates, accounting for 97.9\% (97/99) of cases, with B.1.351 (first identified in South Africa, Beta variant) accounting for 2.0\% (2/99) of cases. No other lineages were observed.
          
          
            Discussion
            In depth analysis of the B.1.1.7 lineages indicates multiple separate introductions and subsequent establishment within the region. Eight samples were identical to genomes observed in Europe (7 UK, 1 Switzerland), indicating recent transmission. Genomes of other samples show evidence that these have evolved, indicating sustained transmission over a period of time either within Pakistan or other countries with low density genome sequencing. Vaccines remain effective against B.1.1.7, however the low level of B.1.351 against which some vaccines are less effective demonstrates the requirement for continued prospective genomic surveillance.},

Common clinical misdiagnosis, antimicrobial resistance, high case fatality and lack of a vaccine make iNTS a priority for global health research. Using whole genome sequence analysis of 164 invasive
              Salmonella
              isolates obtained through population-based surveillance between 2008 and 2016, we conducted genomic analysis of the serovars causing invasive
              Salmonella
              diseases in rural Gambia.
            
          
          
            Results
            The incidence of iNTS varied over time. The proportion of atypical serovars causing disease increased over time from 40\% to 65\% compared to the typical serovars Enteritidis and Typhimurium decreasing from 30\% to 12\%. Overall iNTS case fatality was 10\% with 10\% fatality in cases of atypical iNTS. Genetic virulence factors were identified in 14/70 (20\%) typical serovars and 45/68 (66\%) of the atypical serovars and were associated with: invasion, proliferation and/or translocation (Clade A); and host colonization and immune modulation (Clade G). Among Enteritidis isolates, 33/40 were resistant to ≥4 the antimicrobials tested, except for ciprofloxacin, to which all isolates were susceptible. Resistance was low in Typhimurium isolates, however, all16 isolates were resistant to gentamicin.
          
          
            Conclusion
            The increase in incidence and proportion of iNTS disease caused by atypical serovars is concerning. The increased proportion of atypical serovars and the high associated case fatality may be related to acquisition of specific genetic virulence factors. These factors may provide a selective advantage to the atypical serovars. Investigations should be conducted elsewhere in Africa to identify potential changes in the distribution iNTS serovars and the extent of these virulence elements.},

	abstract = {The Public Health Alliance for Genomic Epidemiology (PHA4GE) (https://pha4ge.org) is a global coalition that is actively working to establish consensus standards, document and share best practices, improve the availability of critical bioinformatic tools and resources, and advocate for greater openness, interoperability, accessibility and reproducibility in public health microbial bioinformatics. In the face of the current pandemic, PHA4GE has identified a clear and present need for a fit-for-purpose, open source SARS-CoV-2 contextual data standard. As such, we have developed an extension to the INSDC pathogen package, providing a SARS-CoV-2 contextual data specification based on harmonisable, publicly available, community standards. The specification is implementable via a collection template, as well as an array of protocols and tools to support the harmonisation and submission of sequence data and contextual information to public repositories. Well-structured, rich contextual data adds value, promotes reuse, and enables aggregation and integration of disparate data sets. Adoption of the proposed standard and practices will better enable interoperability between datasets and systems, improve the consistency and utility of generated data, and ultimately facilitate novel insights and discoveries in SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.},

            Introduction
            
              Understanding mother-to-infant transmission of Group B
              Streptococcus
              (GBS) is vital to the prevention and control of GBS disease. We investigated the transmission and phylogenetic relationships of mothers colonised by GBS and their infants in a peri-urban setting in The Gambia.
            
          
          
            Methods
            We collected nasopharyngeal swabs from 35 mother-infant dyads at weekly intervals from birth until six weeks post-partum. GBS was isolated by conventional microbiology techniques. Whole-genome sequencing was performed on GBS isolates from one mother-infant dyad (dyad 17).
          
          
            Results
            We recovered 85 GBS isolates from the 245 nasopharyngeal swabs. GBS was isolated from 16.33\% and 18.37\% of sampled mothers and infants, respectively. In 87\% of cultured swabs, the culture status of an infant agreed with that of the mother (Kappa p-value {\textless}0.001). In dyad 17, phylogenetic analysis revealed within-host strain diversity in the mother and clone to her infant.
          
          
            Conclusion
            GBS colonisation in mothers presents a significant risk of colonisation in their infants. We confirm vertical transmission from mother to child in dyad 17, accompanied by within-host diversity.},
