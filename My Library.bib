	abstract = {Genome-wide association study (GWAS) methods applied to bacterial genomes have shown promising results for genetic marker discovery or detailed assessment of marker effect. Recently, alignment-free methods based on k-mer composition have proven their ability to explore the accessory genome. However, they lead to redundant descriptions and results which are sometimes hard to interpret. Here we introduce DBGWAS, an extended k-mer-based GWAS method producing interpretable genetic variants associated with distinct phenotypes. Relying on compacted De Bruijn graphs (cDBG), our method gathers cDBG nodes, identified by the association model, into subgraphs defined from their neighbourhood in the initial cDBG. DBGWAS is alignment-free and only requires a set of contigs and phenotypes. In particular, it does not require prior annotation or reference genomes. It produces subgraphs representing phenotype-associated genetic variants such as local polymorphisms and mobile genetic elements (MGE). It offers a graphical framework which helps interpret GWAS results. Importantly it is also computationally efficient—experiments took one hour and a half on average. We validated our method using antibiotic resistance phenotypes for three bacterial species. DBGWAS recovered known resistance determinants such as mutations in core genes in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and genes acquired by horizontal transfer in Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa—along with their MGE context. It also enabled us to formulate new hypotheses involving genetic variants not yet described in the antibiotic resistance literature. An open-source tool implementing DBGWAS is available at https://gitlab.com/leoisl/dbgwas.},

	doi = {10.1056/NEJMoa1106920},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A large outbreak of diarrhea and the hemolytic-uremic syndrome caused by an unusual serotype of Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli (O104:H4) began in Germany in May 2011. As of July 22, a large number of cases of diarrhea caused by Shiga-toxin-producing E. coli have been reported--3167 without the hemolytic-uremic syndrome (16 deaths) and 908 with the hemolytic-uremic syndrome (34 deaths)--indicating that this strain is notably more virulent than most of the Shiga-toxin-producing E. coli strains. Preliminary genetic characterization of the outbreak strain suggested that, unlike most of these strains, it should be classified within the enteroaggregative pathotype of E. coli.
METHODS: We used third-generation, single-molecule, real-time DNA sequencing to determine the complete genome sequence of the German outbreak strain, as well as the genome sequences of seven diarrhea-associated enteroaggregative E. coli serotype O104:H4 strains from Africa and four enteroaggregative E. coli reference strains belonging to other serotypes. Genomewide comparisons were performed with the use of these enteroaggregative E. coli genomes, as well as those of 40 previously sequenced E. coli isolates.
RESULTS: The enteroaggregative E. coli O104:H4 strains are closely related and form a distinct clade among E. coli and enteroaggregative E. coli strains. However, the genome of the German outbreak strain can be distinguished from those of other O104:H4 strains because it contains a prophage encoding Shiga toxin 2 and a distinct set of additional virulence and antibiotic-resistance factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that horizontal genetic exchange allowed for the emergence of the highly virulent Shiga-toxin-producing enteroaggregative E. coli O104:H4 strain that caused the German outbreak. More broadly, these findings highlight the way in which the plasticity of bacterial genomes facilitates the emergence of new pathogens.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The analysis of next-generation sequencing data from large genomes is a timely research topic. Sequencers are producing billions of short sequence fragments from newly sequenced organisms. Computational methods for reconstructing whole genomes/transcriptomes (de novo assemblers) are typically employed to process such data. However, these methods require large memory resources and computation time. Many basic biological questions could be answered targeting specific information in the reads, thus avoiding complete assembly.
RESULTS: We present Mapsembler, an iterative micro and targeted assembler which processes large datasets of reads on commodity hardware. Mapsembler checks for the presence of given regions of interest that can be constructed from reads and builds a short assembly around it, either as a plain sequence or as a graph, showing contextual structure. We introduce new algorithms to retrieve approximate occurrences of a sequence from reads and construct an extension graph. Among other results presented in this paper, Mapsembler enabled to retrieve previously described human breast cancer candidate fusion genes, and to detect new ones not previously known.
CONCLUSIONS: Mapsembler is the first software that enables de novo discovery around a region of interest of repeats, SNPs, exon skipping, gene fusion, as well as other structural events, directly from raw sequencing reads. As indexing is localized, the memory footprint of Mapsembler is negligible.

Close to 75,000 cases of O157:H7 infection are now estimated to occur annually in the United States. The severity of disease, the lack of effective treatment and the potential for large-scale outbreaks from contaminated food supplies have propelled intensive research on the pathogenesis and detection of E. coli O157:H7 (ref. 4). Here we have sequenced the genome of E. coli O157:H7 to identify candidate genes responsible for pathogenesis, to develop better methods of strain detection and to advance our understanding of the evolution of E. coli, through comparison with the genome of the non-pathogenic laboratory strain E. coli K-12 (ref. 5). We find that lateral gene transfer is far more extensive than previously anticipated. In fact, 1,387 new genes encoded in strain-specific clusters of diverse sizes were found in O157:H7. These include candidate virulence factors, alternative metabolic capacities, several prophages and other new functions--all of which could be targets for surveillance.},

SE11 harbored a 4.8 Mb chromosome encoding 4679 protein-coding genes and six plasmids encoding 323 protein-coding genes. None of the SE11 genes had sequence similarity to known genes encoding phage- and plasmid-borne virulence factors found in pathogenic E. coli strains. The comparative genome analysis with the laboratory strain K-12 MG1655 identified 62 poorly conserved genes between these two non-pathogenic strains and 1186 genes absent in MG1655. These genes in SE11 were mostly encoded in large insertion regions on the chromosome or in the plasmids, and were notably abundant in genes of fimbriae and autotransporters, which are cell surface appendages that largely contribute to the adherence ability of bacteria to host cells and bacterial conjugation. These data suggest that SE11 may have evolved to acquire and accumulate the functions advantageous for stable colonization of intestinal cells, and that the adhesion-associated functions are important for the commensality of E. coli in human gut habitat.},

Saline-dialyzed extracts were tested for cytotoxic effects on HeLa cells that were neutralizable with antiserum to Shiga toxin. Among the 13 E. coli strains so analyzed, 11 made a Shiga-like cytotoxin in levels ranging from trace (two avirulent isolates) to amounts equivalent to S. dysenteriae type 1 (two noninvasive strains that did not make E. coli heat-labile or -stable enterotoxins but were isolated from infants with diarrhea). As with extracts of Shiga toxin, lysates of these E. coli strains that produced high levels of Shiga-like toxin were enterotoxic for rabbits, paralytic and lethal for mice, and inhibited protein synthesis in HeLa cells. Thus, these data suggest that Shiga-like toxin may be another heretofore undiscovered factor in the pathogenesis of diarrhea caused by some E. coli strains.},

	abstract = {The burden of diseases caused by food-borne pathogens remains largely unknown. Importantly data indicating trends in food-borne infectious intestinal disease is limited to a few industrialised countries, and even fewer pathogens. It has been predicted that the importance of diarrhoeal disease, mainly due to contaminated food and water, as a cause of death will decline worldwide. Evidence for such a downward trend is limited. This prediction presumes that improvements in the production and retail of microbiologically safe food will be sustained in the developed world and, moreover, will be rolled out to those countries of the developing world increasingly producing food for a global market. In this review evidence is presented to indicate that the microbiological safety of food remains a dynamic situation heavily influenced by multiple factors along the food chain from farm to fork. Sustaining food safety standards will depend on constant vigilance maintained by monitoring and surveillance but, with the rising importance of other food-related issues, such as food security, obesity and climate change, competition for resources in the future to enable this may be fierce. In addition the pathogen populations relevant to food safety are not static. Food is an excellent vehicle by which many pathogens (bacteria, viruses/prions and parasites) can reach an appropriate colonisation site in a new host. Although food production practices change, the well-recognised food-borne pathogens, such as Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli, seem able to evolve to exploit novel opportunities, for example fresh produce, and even generate new public health challenges, for example antimicrobial resistance. In addition, previously unknown food-borne pathogens, many of which are zoonotic, are constantly emerging. Current understanding of the trends in food-borne diseases for bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens has been reviewed. The bacterial pathogens are exemplified by those well-recognized by policy makers; i.e. Salmonella, Campylobacter, E. coli and Listeria monocytogenes. Antimicrobial resistance in several bacterial food-borne pathogens (Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella and Vibrio spp., methicillin resistant Staphylcoccus aureas, E. coli and Enterococci) has been discussed as a separate topic because of its relative importance to policy issues. Awareness and surveillance of viral food-borne pathogens is generally poor but emphasis is placed on Norovirus, Hepatitis A, rotaviruses and newly emerging viruses such as SARS. Many food-borne parasitic pathogens are known (for example Ascaris, Cryptosporidia and Trichinella) but few of these are effectively monitored in foods, livestock and wildlife and their epidemiology through the food-chain is poorly understood. The lessons learned and future challenges in each topic are debated. It is clear that one overall challenge is the generation and maintenance of constructive dialogue and collaboration between public health, veterinary and food safety experts, bringing together multidisciplinary skills and multi-pathogen expertise. Such collaboration is essential to monitor changing trends in the well-recognised diseases and detect emerging pathogens. It will also be necessary understand the multiple interactions these pathogens have with their environments during transmission along the food chain in order to develop effective prevention and control strategies.},

Some E. coli strains, however, have developed the ability to cause disease of the gastrointestinal, urinary, or central nervous system in even the most robust human hosts. Diarrheagenic strains of E. coli can be divided into at least six different categories with corresponding distinct pathogenic schemes. Taken together, these organisms probably represent the most common cause of pediatric diarrhea worldwide. Several distinct clinical syndromes accompany infection with diarrheagenic E. coli categories, including traveler's diarrhea (enterotoxigenic E. coli), hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (enterohemorrhagic E. coli), persistent diarrhea (enteroaggregative E. coli), and watery diarrhea of infants (entero-pathogenic E. coli). This review discusses the current level of understanding of the pathogenesis of the diarrheagenic E. coli strains and describes how their pathogenic schemes underlie the clinical manifestations, diagnostic approach, and epidemiologic investigation of these important pathogens.},

	abstract = {A Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) strain belonging to serotype O104:H4, phylogenetic group B1 and sequence type ST678, with virulence features common to the enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) pathotype, was reported as the cause of the recent 2011 outbreak in Germany. The outbreak strain was determined to carry several virulence factors of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) and to be resistant to a wide range of antibiotics. There are only a few reports of serotype O104:H4, which is very rare in humans and has never been detected in animals or food. Several research groups obtained the complete genome sequence of isolates of the German outbreak strain as well as the genome sequences of EAEC of serotype O104:H4 strains from Africa. Those findings suggested that horizontal genetic transfer allowed the emergence of the highly virulent Shiga-toxin-producing enteroaggregative E. coli (STEAEC) O104:H4 strain responsible for the outbreak in Germany. Epidemiologic investigations supported a linkage between the outbreaks in Germany and France and traced their origin to fenugreek seeds imported from Africa. However, there has been no isolation of the causative strain O104:H4 from any of the samples of fenugreek seeds analyzed. Following the German outbreak, we conducted a large sampling to analyze the presence of STEC, EAEC, and other types of diarrheagenic E. coli strains in Spanish vegetables. During June and July 2011, 200 vegetable samples from different origins were analyzed. All were negative for the virulent serotype O104:H4 and only one lettuce sample (0.6\%) was positive for a STEC strain of serotype O146:H21 (stx1, stx2), considered of low virulence. Despite the single positive case, the hygienic and sanitary quality of Spanish vegetables proved to be quite good. In 195 of the 200 samples (98\%), {\textless}10 colony-forming units (cfu) of E. coli per gram were detected, and the microbiological levels of all samples were satisfactory ({\textless}100 cfu/g). The samples were also negative for other pathotypes of diarrheagenic E. coli (EAEC, ETEC, tEPEC, and EIEC). Consistent with data from other countries, STEC belonging to serotype O157:H7 and other serotypes have been isolated from beef, milk, cheese, and domestic (cattle, sheep, goats) and wild (deer, boar, fox) animals in Spain. Nevertheless, STEC outbreaks in Spain are rare.},

School lunches served on July 1 and 8 in the North-East District and on July 1, 4, 8, and 9 in the Middle-South District were proposed by a food consumption study to be associated with infection. White radish sprouts from a single farm were the only uncooked food common to the most highly implicated meals on the involved days in two school districts (sweet and sour chicken with lettuce on July 8 in the North-East District and chilled Japanese noodles on July 9 in the Middle-South District). Two incidents of E. coli O157:H7 in neighboring areas were also related to white radish sprouts from the farm. The pulse-field gel electrophoresis patterns of isolates from patients in these two districts and the neighboring areas were identical.

Serotype O104:H4, which has not been detected in animals, has rarely been associated with HUS in the past. To prospectively elucidate the unique characteristics of this strain in the early stages of this outbreak, we applied whole genome sequencing on the Life Technologies Ion Torrent PGM™ sequencer and Optical Mapping to characterize one outbreak isolate (LB226692) and a historic O104:H4 HUS isolate from 2001 (01-09591). Reference guided draft assemblies of both strains were completed with the newly introduced PGM™ within 62 hours. The HUS-associated strains both carried genes typically found in two types of pathogenic E. coli, enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). Phylogenetic analyses of 1,144 core E. coli genes indicate that the HUS-causing O104:H4 strains and the previously published sequence of the EAEC strain 55989 show a close relationship but are only distantly related to common EHEC serotypes. Though closely related, the outbreak strain differs from the 2001 strain in plasmid content and fimbrial genes. We propose a model in which EAEC 55989 and EHEC O104:H4 strains evolved from a common EHEC O104:H4 progenitor, and suggest that by stepwise gain and loss of chromosomal and plasmid-encoded virulence factors, a highly pathogenic hybrid of EAEC and EHEC emerged as the current outbreak clone.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) cause most cases of the hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) worldwide. To investigate genetic changes in EHEC during the course of human infection, we analyzed consecutive stool samples and shed isolates from patients with HUS, focusing on the genes encoding Shiga toxin (stx) and intimin (eae).
METHODS: Sequential stool samples from 210 patients with HUS were investigated for the persistence of E. coli strains harboring stx and/or eae. Initial stool samples were collected during the acute phase of HUS, and subsequent stool samples were collected 3-16 days later (median interval, 8 days).
RESULTS: Organisms that were stx and eae positive (stx+/eae+ strains; n=137) or stx negative and eae positive (stx-/eae+ strains; n=5) were detected in the initial stool samples from 142 patients. Subsequently, the proportion of those who shed stx+/eae+ strains decreased to 13 of 210 patients, whereas the proportion of those who shed strains that were stx-/eae+ increased to 12 of 210 patients. Seven patients who initially excreted strains that were stx+/eae+ shed, at second analysis, stx-/eae+ strains of the same serotypes; they had no free fecal Shiga toxin at follow-up. Comparison of the initial and follow-up isolates from these patients with use of molecular-epidemiological methods revealed loss of stx genes and genomic rearrangement.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the loss of a critical bacterial virulence factor from pathogens during very brief intervals in the human host. These genetic changes have evolutionary, diagnostic, and clinical implications. Generation of stx- mutants might contribute to subclonal evolution and evolutionary success.},

Most strains of EHEC carry the locus for enterocyte effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island, but a proportion of isolates from patients with severe disease do not carry LEE and very little is known about virulence factors in these organisms. LEE-negative strains of EHEC typically express Shiga toxin 2 and carry a large plasmid that encodes the production of EHEC hemolysin. In this study, we determined the nucleotide sequence of the transfer region of pO113, the large hemolysin plasmid from LEE-negative EHEC O113:H21 (EH41). This 63.9-kb region showed a high degree of similarity with the transfer region of R64, and pO113 was capable of self-transmission at low frequencies. Unlike R64 and the related dot/icm system of Legionella pneumophila, however, pO113 was unable to mobilize RSF1010. In addition, the pO113 transfer region encoded a novel high-molecular-weight serine protease autotransporter of Enterobacteriaceae (SPATE) protein, termed EpeA. Like other SPATEs, EpeA exhibited protease activity and mucinase activity, but expression was not associated with a cytopathic effect on epithelial cells. Analysis of a second high-molecular-weight secreted protein revealed that pO113 also encodes EspP, a cytopathic SPATE identified previously in EHEC O157:H7. The nucleotide sequences encoding the predicted beta-domains of espP and epeA were identical and also shared significant homology with a third SPATE protein, EspI. Both espP and epeA were detected in several LEE-negative clinical isolates of EHEC and thus may contribute to the pathogenesis of this subset of EHEC.},

The markers included insertions, deletions, substitutions and a simple single nucleotide polymorphism creating a BamHI site. The Shiga toxin gene profile of the spinach-associated outbreak isolates (stx1(-) stx2(+) stx2c(+)) correlated with prophage insertions different from those in the prototypical EDL933 and Sakai reference strains (stx1(+) stx2(+) stx2c(-)). The prophage occupying the yehV chromosomal position in the spinach-associated outbreak isolates was similar to the stx1(+) EDL933 cryptic prophage V, but it lacked the stx1 gene. In EDL933, the stx2 genes are within prophage BP933-W at the wrbA chromosomal locus; this locus was unoccupied in the spinach outbreak isolates. Instead, the stx2 genes were found within a chimeric BP933-W-like prophage with a different integrase, inserted at the argW locus in the outbreak isolates. An extra set of Shiga toxin genes, stx2c, was found in the outbreak isolates within a prophage integrated at the sbcB locus. The optical maps of two additional clinical isolates from the outbreak showed a single, different prophage variation in each, suggesting that changes occurred in the source strain during the course of this widespread, multi-state outbreak.},

Of the 7 of 15 patients who did not have VT+ E. coli, 2 were positive for faecal VT, and a third (patient K) had strong serological evidence of VT+ E. coli infection. 2 HUS patients, including patient F, had siblings with uncomplicated diarrhoea who had both VT+ E. coli in the stools and faecal VT activity. Thus 11 of 15 (73\%) of the HUS cases had evidence of infection by VT+ E. coli, suggesting that there was an association between these organisms and these cases of HUS.

Serogroups O26, O111, and O103 cause most known outbreaks related to non-O157 STEC. Pathogenicity islands (PAIs) play a major role in the evolution of STEC pathogenicity. To determine the distribution of PAIs often associated with highly virulent STECs (OI-122, OI-43/48, OI-57, and high pathogenicity islands) among STEC O26, O103, and O111, a collection of STEC O26 (n=45), O103 (n=29), and O111 (n=52) from humans and animals were included in this study. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) with XbaI digestion was used to characterize the clonal relationship of the strains. In addition, a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay was used to determine eae subtypes. Additional virulence genes on PAIs were identified using specific PCR assays, including OI-122: pagC, sen, efa-1, efa-2, and nleB; OI-43/48: terC, ureC, iha, and aidA-1; OI-57: nleG2-3, nleG5-2, and nleG6-2; and HPI: fyuA and irp2. A PFGE dendrogram demonstrated that instead of clustering together with strains from the same O type (O111:H8), the O111:H11 (n=14) strains clustered together with strains of the same H type (O26:H11, n=45). In addition, O26:H11 and O111:H11 strains carried eae subtype β, whereas O111:H8 strains had eae γ2/θ. The O26:H11 and O111:H11 stains contained an incomplete OI-122 lacking pagC and a complete HPI. However, a complete OI-122 but no HPI was found in the O111:H8 strains. Additionally, aidA-1 of OI-43/48 and nleG6-2 of OI-57 were significantly associated with O26:H11 and O111:H11 strains but were almost missing in O111:H8 strains (p{\textless}0.001). This study demonstrated that H11 (O111:H11 and O26:H11) strains were closely related and may have come from the same ancestor.},

In the United States, non-O157 E. coli may account for up to 20\%-50\% of all STEC infections. A high index of suspicion, paired with options to test for non-O157 STEC infection, are necessary for early recognition and appropriate treatment of these infections. Supportive care without the use of antibiotics is currently considered to be optimal treatment for all STEC infections.

We present here complete genome sequences of two E. coli B strains, REL606, used in a long-term evolution experiment, and BL21(DE3), widely used to express recombinant proteins. The two genomes differ in length by 72,304 bp and have 426 single base pair differences, a seemingly large difference for laboratory strains having a common ancestor within the last 67 years. Transpositions by IS1 and IS150 have occurred in both lineages. Integration of the DE3 prophage in BL21(DE3) apparently displaced a defective prophage in the lambda attachment site of B. As might have been anticipated from the many genetic and biochemical experiments comparing B and K-12 over the years, the B genomes are similar in size and organization to the genome of E. coli K-12 MG1655 and have {\textgreater}99\% sequence identity over approximately 92\% of their genomes. E. coli B and K-12 differ considerably in distribution of IS elements and in location and composition of larger mobile elements. An unexpected difference is the absence of a large cluster of flagella genes in B, due to a 41 kbp IS1-mediated deletion. Gene clusters that specify the LPS core, O antigen, and restriction enzymes differ substantially, presumably because of horizontal transfer. Comparative analysis of 32 independently isolated E. coli and Shigella genomes, both commensals and pathogenic strains, identifies a minimal set of genes in common plus many strain-specific genes that constitute a large E. coli pan-genome.},

	abstract = {Using in silico analysis we studied a novel family of repetitive DNA sequences that is present among both domains of the prokaryotes (Archaea and Bacteria), but absent from eukaryotes or viruses. This family is characterized by direct repeats, varying in size from 21 to 37 bp, interspaced by similarly sized non-repetitive sequences. To appreciate their characteri-stic structure, we will refer to this family as the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR). In most species with two or more CRISPR loci, these loci were flanked on one side by a common leader sequence of 300-500 b. The direct repeats and the leader sequences were conserved within a species, but dissimilar between species. The presence of multiple chromosomal CRISPR loci suggests that CRISPRs are mobile elements. Four CRISPR-associated (cas) genes were identified in CRISPR-containing prokaryotes that were absent from CRISPR-negative prokaryotes. The cas genes were invariably located adjacent to a CRISPR locus, indicating that the cas genes and CRISPR loci have a functional relationship. The cas3 gene showed motifs characteristic for helicases of the superfamily 2, and the cas4 gene showed motifs of the RecB family of exonucleases, suggesting that these genes are involved in DNA metabolism or gene expression. The spatial coherence of CRISPR and cas genes may stimulate new research on the genesis and biological role of these repeats and genes.},

Here we report the complete chromosome sequence of an O157:H7 strain isolated from the Sakai outbreak, and the results of genomic comparison with a benign laboratory strain, K-12 MG1655. The chromosome is 5.5 Mb in size, 859 Kb larger than that of K-12. We identified a 4.1-Mb sequence highly conserved between the two strains, which may represent the fundamental backbone of the E. coli chromosome. The remaining 1.4-Mb sequence comprises of O157:H7-specific sequences, most of which are horizontally transferred foreign DNAs. The predominant roles of bacteriophages in the emergence of O157:H7 is evident by the presence of 24 prophages and prophage-like elements that occupy more than half of the O157:H7-specific sequences. The O157:H7 chromosome encodes 1632 proteins and 20 tRNAs that are not present in K-12. Among these, at least 131 proteins are assumed to have virulence-related functions. Genome-wide codon usage analysis suggested that the O157:H7-specific tRNAs are involved in the efficient expression of the strain-specific genes. A complete set of the genes specific to O157:H7 presented here sheds new insight into the pathogenicity and the physiology of O157:H7, and will open a way to fully understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the O157:H7 infection.},

	abstract = {PhyML is a phylogeny software based on the maximum-likelihood principle. Early PhyML versions used a fast algorithm performing nearest neighbor interchanges to improve a reasonable starting tree topology. Since the original publication (Guindon S., Gascuel O. 2003. A simple, fast and accurate algorithm to estimate large phylogenies by maximum likelihood. Syst. Biol. 52:696-704), PhyML has been widely used ({\textgreater}2500 citations in ISI Web of Science) because of its simplicity and a fair compromise between accuracy and speed. In the meantime, research around PhyML has continued, and this article describes the new algorithms and methods implemented in the program. First, we introduce a new algorithm to search the tree space with user-defined intensity using subtree pruning and regrafting topological moves. The parsimony criterion is used here to filter out the least promising topology modifications with respect to the likelihood function. The analysis of a large collection of real nucleotide and amino acid data sets of various sizes demonstrates the good performance of this method. Second, we describe a new test to assess the support of the data for internal branches of a phylogeny. This approach extends the recently proposed approximate likelihood-ratio test and relies on a nonparametric, Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like procedure. A detailed analysis of real alignments sheds light on the links between this new approach and the more classical nonparametric bootstrap method. Overall, our tests show that the last version (3.0) of PhyML is fast, accurate, stable, and ready to use. A Web server and binary files are available from http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml/.},

Isolates of Escherichia coli O104:H4 from the outbreak centered in Germany in May-July 2011, and the much smaller outbreak in southwest France in June 2011, were indistinguishable by standard tests. We report a molecular epidemiological analysis using multiplatform whole-genome sequencing and analysis of multiple isolates from the German and French outbreaks. Isolates from the German outbreak showed remarkably little diversity, with only two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) found in isolates from four individuals. Surprisingly, we found much greater diversity (19 SNPs) in isolates from seven individuals infected in the French outbreak. The German isolates form a clade within the more diverse French outbreak strains. Moreover, five isolates derived from a single infected individual from the French outbreak had extremely limited diversity. The striking difference in diversity between the German and French outbreak samples is consistent with several hypotheses, including a bottleneck that purged diversity in the German isolates, variation in mutation rates in the two E. coli outbreak populations, or uneven distribution of diversity in the seed populations that led to each outbreak.},

The associations of VFs with phylogenetic background were assessed among the strains in comparison with the different seropathotypes. The phylogenetic analysis showed that STEC strains segregated mainly in phylogenetic group B1 (70\%) and revealed the substantial prevalence (19\%) of STEC belonging to phylogenetic group A (designated STEC-A). The presence of virulent clonal groups in seropathotypes that are associated with disease and their absence from seropathotypes that are not associated with disease support the concept of seropathotype classification. Although certain VFs (eae, stx(2-EDL933), stx(2-vha), and stx(2-vhb)) were concentrated in seropathotypes associated with disease, others (astA, HPI, stx(1c), and stx(2-NV206)) were concentrated in seropathotypes that are not associated with disease. Taken together with the observation that the STEC-A group was exclusively composed of strains lacking eae recovered from seropathotypes that are not associated with disease, the "atypical" virulence pattern suggests that STEC-A strains comprise a distinct category of STEC strains. A practical benefit of our phylogenetic analysis of STEC strains is that phylogenetic group A status appears to be highly predictive of "nonvirulent" seropathotypes.},

	abstract = {Serogroup classifications based upon the O-somatic antigen of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) provide significant epidemiological information on clinical isolates. Each O-antigen determinant is encoded by a unique cluster of genes present between the gnd and galF chromosomal genes. Alternatively, serogroup-specific polymorphisms might be encoded in loci that are encoded outside of the O-antigen gene cluster. Segments of the core bacterial loci mdh, gnd, gcl, ppk, metA, ftsZ, relA and metG for 30 O26 STEC strains have previously been sequenced, and comparative analyses to O157 distinguished these two serogroups. To screen these loci for serogroup-specific traits within a broader range of clinically significant serogroups, DNA sequences were obtained for 19 strains of 10 additional STEC serogroups. Unique alleles were observed at the gnd locus for each examined STEC serogroup, and this correlation persisted when comparative analyses were extended to 144 gnd sequences from 26 O-serogroups (comprising 42 O : H-serotypes). These included O157, O121, O103, O26, O5 : non-motile (NM), O145 : NM, O113 : H21, O111 : NM and O117 : H7 STEC; and furthermore, non-toxin encoding O157, O26, O55, O6 and O117 strains encoded distinct gnd alleles compared to STEC strains of the same serogroup. DNA sequencing of a 643 bp region of gnd was, therefore, sufficient to minimally determine the O-antigen of STEC through molecular means, and the location of gnd next to the O-antigen gene cluster offered additional support for the co-inheritance of these determinants. The gnd DNA sequence-based serogrouping method could improve the typing capabilities for STEC in clinical laboratories, and was used successfully to characterize O121 : H19, O26 : H11 and O177 : NM clinical isolates prior to serological confirmation during outbreak investigations.},

	abstract = {The isolation of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) other than serogroup O157 from clinical stool samples is problematic due to the lack of differential phenotypic characteristics from non-pathogenic E. coli. The development of molecular reagents capable of identifying both toxin and serogroup-specific genetic determinants holds promise for a more comprehensive characterization of stool samples and isolation of STEC strains. In this study, 876 stool samples from paediatric patients with gastroenteritis were screened for STEC using a cytotoxicity assay, commercial immunoassay and a conventional PCR targeting Shiga-toxin determinants. In addition, routine culture methods for isolating O157 STEC were also performed. The screening assays identified 45 stools presumptively containing STEC, and using non-differential culture techniques a total of 20 O157 and 22 non-O157 strains were isolated. These included STEC serotypes O157 : H7, O26 : H11, O121 : H19, O26 : NM, O103 : H2, O111 : NM, O115 : H18, O121 : NM, O145 : NM, O177 : NM and O5 : NM. Notably, multiple STEC serotypes were isolated from two clinical stool samples (yielding O157 : H7 and O26 : H11, or O157 : H7 and O103 : H2 isolates). These data were compared to molecular serogroup profiles determined directly from the stool enrichment cultures using a LUX real-time PCR assay targeting the O157 fimbrial gene lpfA, a microsphere suspension array targeting allelic variants of espZ and a gnd-based molecular O-antigen serogrouping method. The genetic profile of individual stool cultures indicated that the espZ microsphere array and lpfA real-time PCR assay could accurately predict the presence and provide preliminary typing for the STEC strains present in clinical samples. The gnd-based molecular serogrouping method provided additional corroborative evidence of serogroup identities. This toolbox of molecular methods provided robust detection capabilities for STEC in clinical stool samples, including co-infection of multiple serogroups.},

	abstract = {The increasing occurrence of multidrug-resistant pathogens of clinical and agricultural importance is a global public health concern. While antimicrobial use in human and veterinary medicine is known to contribute to the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance, the impact of microbial communities and mobile resistance genes from the environment in this process is not well understood. Isolated from an industrially polluted aquatic environment, Escherichia coli SMS-3-5 is resistant to a record number of antimicrobial compounds from all major classes, including two front-line fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin), and in many cases at record-high concentrations. To gain insights into antimicrobial resistance in environmental bacterial populations, the genome of E. coli SMS-3-5 was sequenced and compared to the genome sequences of other E. coli strains. In addition, selected genetic loci from E. coli SMS-3-5 predicted to be involved in antimicrobial resistance were phenotypically characterized. Using recombinant vector clones from shotgun sequencing libraries, resistance to tetracycline, streptomycin, and sulfonamide/trimethoprim was assigned to a single mosaic region on a 130-kb plasmid (pSMS35\_130). The remaining plasmid backbone showed similarity to virulence plasmids from avian-pathogenic E. coli (APEC) strains. Individual resistance gene cassettes from pSMS35\_130 are conserved among resistant bacterial isolates from multiple phylogenetic and geographic sources. Resistance to quinolones was assigned to several chromosomal loci, mostly encoding transport systems that are also present in susceptible E. coli isolates. Antimicrobial resistance in E. coli SMS-3-5 is therefore dependent both on determinants acquired from a mobile gene pool that is likely available to clinical and agricultural pathogens, as well, and on specifically adapted multidrug efflux systems. The association of antimicrobial resistance with APEC virulence genes on pSMS35\_130 highlights the risk of promoting the spread of virulence through the extensive use of antibiotics.},

P. Leatham et al., Infect. Immun. 73:8039-8049, 2005). This intestine-adapted strain (E. coli MG1655*) grew faster on several different carbon sources than the wild type and was nonmotile due to deletion of the flhD gene. We now report the results of several high-throughput genomic analysis approaches to further characterize E. coli MG1655*. Whole-genome pyrosequencing did not reveal any changes on its genome, aside from the deletion at the flhDC locus, that could explain the colonization advantage of E. coli MG1655*. Microarray analysis revealed modest yet significant induction of catabolic gene systems across the genome in both E. coli MG1655* and an isogenic flhD mutant constructed in the laboratory. Catabolome analysis with Biolog GN2 microplates revealed an enhanced ability of both E. coli MG1655* and the isogenic flhD mutant to oxidize a variety of carbon sources. The results show that intestine-adapted E. coli MG1655* is more fit than the wild type for intestinal colonization, because loss of FlhD results in elevated expression of genes involved in carbon and energy metabolism, resulting in more efficient carbon source utilization and a higher intestinal population. Hence, mutations that enhance metabolic efficiency confer a colonization advantage.},

	abstract = {Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) are diarrheagenic pathotypes of E. coli that cause gastrointestinal disease with the potential for life-threatening sequelae. While certain EHEC and EPEC virulence mechanisms have been extensively studied, the factors that mediate host colonization remain to be properly defined. Previously, we identified four genes (ehaA, ehaB, ehaC, and ehaD) from the prototypic EHEC strain EDL933 that encode for proteins that belong to the autotransporter (AT) family. Here we have examined the prevalence of these genes, as well as several other AT-encoding genes, in a collection of EHEC and EPEC strains. We show that the complement of AT-encoding genes in EHEC and EPEC strains is variable, with some AT-encoding genes being highly prevalent. One previously uncharacterized AT-encoding gene, which we have termed ehaJ, was identified in 12/44 (27\%) of EHEC and 2/20 (10\%) of EPEC strains. The ehaJ gene lies immediately adjacent to a gene encoding a putative glycosyltransferase (referred to as egtA). Western blot analysis using an EhaJ-specific antibody indicated that EhaJ is glycosylated by EgtA. Expression of EhaJ in a recombinant E. coli strain, revealed EhaJ is located at the cell surface and in the presence of the egtA glycosyltransferase gene mediates strong biofilm formation in microtiter plate and flow cell assays. EhaJ also mediated adherence to a range of extracellular matrix proteins, however this occurred independent of glycosylation. We also demonstrate that EhaJ is expressed in a wild-type EPEC strain following in vitro growth. However, deletion of ehaJ did not significantly alter its adherence or biofilm properties. In summary, EhaJ is a new glycosylated AT protein from EPEC and EHEC. Further studies are required to elucidate the function of EhaJ in colonization and virulence.},

Specificity estimates for the CRISPR PCR assays varied from 97.5\% to 100\%. Sensitivity estimates for the assays ranged from 95.7\% to 100\%. The assays targeting EHEC O145:H28, O103:H2, and O45:H2 displayed 100\% sensitivity. The combined usage of two simplex PCR assays targeting different sequences of the O26 CRISPR locus allowed detection of EHEC O26:H11 with 100\% sensitivity. By combining two simplex PCR assays targeting different sequences of the EHEC O157 CRISPR locus, EHEC O157:H7 was detected with 99.56\% sensitivity. EHEC O111:H8 and EHEC O121:H19 were detected with 95.9\% and 95.7\% sensitivity, respectively. This study demonstrates that the identification of EHEC serotype-specific CRISPR sequences is more specific than the mere identification of O-antigen gene sequences, as is used in current PCR protocols for detection of EHEC strains.},

As such, E. coli represents an attractive organism to study how environment impacts microbial genome structure and function. Uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) must adapt to life in several microbial communities in the human body, and has a complex life cycle in the bladder when it causes acute or recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI). Several studies designed to identify virulence factors have focused on genes that are uniquely represented in UPEC strains, whereas the role of genes that are common to all E. coli has received much less attention. Here we describe the complete 5,065,741-bp genome sequence of a UPEC strain recovered from a patient with an acute bladder infection and compare it with six other finished E. coli genome sequences. We searched 3,470 ortholog sets for genes that are under positive selection only in UPEC strains. Our maximum likelihood-based analysis yielded 29 genes involved in various aspects of cell surface structure, DNA metabolism, nutrient acquisition, and UTI. These results were validated by resequencing a subset of the 29 genes in a panel of 50 urinary, periurethral, and rectal E. coli isolates from patients with UTI. These studies outline a computational approach that may be broadly applicable for studying strain-specific adaptation and pathogenesis in other bacteria.},

	abstract = {The widespread presence of antibiotic resistance and virulence among Staphylococcus isolates has been attributed in part to lateral genetic transfer (LGT), but little is known about the broader extent of LGT within this genus. Here we report the first systematic study of the modularity of genetic transfer among 13 Staphylococcus genomes covering four distinct named species. Using a topology-based phylogenetic approach, we found, among 1,354 sets of homologous genes examined, strong evidence of LGT in 368 (27.1\%) gene sets, and weaker evidence in another 259 (19.1\%). Within-gene and whole-gene transfer contribute almost equally to the topological discordance of these gene sets against a reference phylogeny. Comparing genetic transfer in single-copy and in multicopy gene sets, we observed a higher frequency of LGT in the latter, and a substantial functional bias in cases of whole-gene transfer (little such bias was observed in cases of fragmentary genetic transfer). We found evidence that lateral transfer, particularly of entire genes, impacts not only functions related to antibiotic, drug, and heavy-metal resistance, as well as membrane transport, but also core informational and metabolic functions not associated with mobile elements. Although patterns of sequence similarity support the cohesion of recognized species, LGT within S. aureus appears frequently to disrupt clonal complexes. Our results demonstrate that LGT and gene duplication play important parts in functional innovation in staphylococcal genomes.},

While Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) outperforms exact methods through its use of heuristics, the speed of the current BLAST software is suboptimal for very long queries or database sequences. There are also some shortcomings in the user-interface of the current command-line applications.
RESULTS: We describe features and improvements of rewritten BLAST software and introduce new command-line applications. Long query sequences are broken into chunks for processing, in some cases leading to dramatically shorter run times. For long database sequences, it is possible to retrieve only the relevant parts of the sequence, reducing CPU time and memory usage for searches of short queries against databases of contigs or chromosomes. The program can now retrieve masking information for database sequences from the BLAST databases. A new modular software library can now access subject sequence data from arbitrary data sources. We introduce several new features, including strategy files that allow a user to save and reuse their favorite set of options. The strategy files can be uploaded to and downloaded from the NCBI BLAST web site.
CONCLUSION: The new BLAST command-line applications, compared to the current BLAST tools, demonstrate substantial speed improvements for long queries as well as chromosome length database sequences. We have also improved the user interface of the command-line applications.},

The two analyzed strains were designated E. coli GOS1 and GOS2 (German outbreak strain). Both isolates comprise one chromosome of approximately 5.31 Mbp and two putative plasmids. Comparisons of the 5,217 (GOS1) and 5,224 (GOS2) predicted protein-encoding genes with various E. coli strains, and a multilocus sequence typing analysis revealed that the isolates were most similar to the entero-aggregative E. coli (EAEC) strain 55989. In addition, one of the putative plasmids of the outbreak strain is similar to pAA-type plasmids of EAEC strains, which contain aggregative adhesion fimbrial operons. The second putative plasmid harbors genes for extended-spectrum β-lactamases. This type of plasmid is widely distributed in pathogenic E. coli strains. A significant difference of the E. coli GOS1 and GOS2 genomes to those of EAEC strains is the presence of a prophage encoding the Shiga toxin, which is characteristic for enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) strains.

But the extent of recombination within many organisms is unknown, and even determining its presence within a set of homologous sequences is a difficult question.

We show through simulation that our test can discriminate effectively between the presence and absence of recombination, even in diverse situations such as exponential growth (star-like topologies) and patterns of substitution rate correlation. A number of other tests, Max chi2, NSS, a coalescent-based likelihood permutation test (from LDHat), and correlation of linkage disequilibrium (both r2 and /D'/) with distance, all tend to underestimate the presence of recombination under strong population growth. Moreover, both Max chi2 and NSS falsely infer the presence of recombination under a simple model of mutation rate correlation. Results on empirical data show that our test can be used to detect recombination between closely as well as distantly related samples, regardless of the suspected rate of recombination. The results suggest that phi(w) is one of the best approaches to distinguish recurrent mutation from recombination in a wide variety of circumstances.},

After transcription of the CRISPR, a complex of Cas proteins termed Cascade cleaves a CRISPR RNA precursor in each repeat and retains the cleavage products containing the virus-derived sequence. Assisted by the helicase Cas3, these mature CRISPR RNAs then serve as small guide RNAs that enable Cascade to interfere with virus proliferation.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O157:H7 is a well-recognized cause of bloody diarrhea and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). Non-O157 STEC contribute to this burden of illness but have been underrecognized as a result of diagnostic limitations and inadequate surveillance.
METHODS: Between 1983 and 2002, 43 state public health laboratories submitted 940 human non-O157 STEC isolates from persons with sporadic illnesses to the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention reference laboratory for confirmation and serotyping.
RESULTS: The most common serogroups were O26 (22\%), O111 (16\%), O103 (12\%), O121 (8\%), O45 (7\%), and O145 (5\%). Non-O157 STEC infections were most frequent during the summer and among young persons (median age, 12 years; interquartile range, 3-37 years). Virulence gene profiles were as follows: 61\% stx(1) but not stx(2); 22\% stx(2) but not stx(1); 17\% both stx(1) and stx(2); 84\% intimin (eae); and 86\% enterohemolysin (E-hly). stx(2) was strongly associated with an increased risk of HUS, and eae was strongly associated with an increased risk of bloody diarrhea. STEC O111 accounted for most cases of HUS and was also the cause of 3 of 7 non-O157 STEC outbreaks reported in the United States.
CONCLUSIONS: Non-O157 STEC can cause severe illness that is comparable to the illness caused by STEC O157. Strains that produce Shiga toxin 2 are much more likely to cause HUS than are those that produce Shiga toxin 1 alone. Improving surveillance will more fully elucidate the incidence and pathological spectrum of these emerging agents. These efforts require increased clinical suspicion, improved clinical laboratory isolation, and continued serotyping of isolates in public health laboratories.},

In this study we describe the development of a PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay that distinguishes stx(1c) from other stx(1) subtypes. The PCR-RFLP assay was used to study 378 stx(1)-containing STEC isolates. Of these, 207 were isolated from sheep, 104 from cattle, 45 from humans, 11 from meat, 5 from swine, 5 from unknown sources, and 1 from a cattle water trough. Three hundred fifty-five of the 378 isolates (93.9\%) also possessed at least one other associated virulence gene (ehxA, eaeA, and/or stx(2)); the combination stx(1), stx(2), and ehxA was the most common (175 of 355 [49.3\%]), and 90 of 355 (25.4\%) isolates possessed eaeA. One hundred thirty-six of 207 (65.7\%) ovine isolates possessed stx(1c) alone and belonged to 41 serotypes. Seventy-one of 136 (52.2\%) comprised the common ovine serotypes O5:H(-), O128:H2, and O123:H(-). Fifty-two of 207 isolates (25.1\%) possessed an stx(1) subtype; 27 (51.9\%) of these belonged to serotype O91:H(-). Nineteen of 207 isolates (9.2\%) contained both stx(1c) and stx(1) subtypes, and 14 belonged to serotype O75:H8. In marked contrast, 97 of 104 (93.3\%) bovine isolates comprising 44 serotypes possessed an stx(1) subtype, 6 isolates possessed stx(1c), and the remaining isolate possessed both stx(1c) and stx(1) subtypes. Ten of 11 (91\%) isolates cultured from meat in New Zealand possessed stx(1c) (serotypes O5:H(-), O75:H8/H40, O81:H26, O88:H25, O104:H(-)/H7, O123:H(-)/H10, and O128:H2); most of these serotypes are commonly recovered from the feces of healthy sheep. Serotypes containing stx(1) recovered from cattle rarely were the same as those isolated from sheep. Although an stx(1c) subtype was never associated with the typical enterohemorrhagic E. coli serogroups O26, O103, O111, O113, and O157, 13 human isolates possessed stx(1c). Of these, six isolates with serotype O128:H2 (from patients with diarrhea), four O5:H(-) isolates (from patients with hemolytic-uremic syndrome), and three isolates with serotypes O123:H(-) (diarrhea), OX3:H8 (hemolytic-uremic syndrome), and O81:H6 (unknown health status) represent serotypes that are commonly isolated from sheep.},

However, numerous other non-O157 STEC strains are associated with diseases of various severities and have become an increasing concern to the beef industry, regulatory officials, and the public. This study reports on the prevalence and characterization of non-O157 STEC in commercial ground beef samples (n = 4,133) obtained from numerous manufacturers across the United States over a period of 24 months. All samples were screened by DNA amplification for the presence of Shiga toxin genes, which were present in 1,006 (24.3\%) of the samples. Then, culture isolation of an STEC isolate from all samples that contained stx(1) and/or stx(2) was attempted. Of the 1,006 positive ground beef samples screened for stx, 300 (7.3\% of the total of 4,133) were confirmed to have at least one strain of STEC present by culture isolation. In total, 338 unique STEC isolates were recovered from the 300 samples that yielded an STEC isolate. All unique STEC isolates were serotyped and were characterized for the presence of known virulence factors. These included Shiga toxin subtypes, intimin subtypes, and accessory virulence factors related to adherence (saa, iha, lifA), toxicity (cnf, subA, astA), iron acquisition (chuA), and the presence of the large 60-MDa virulence plasmid (espP, etpD, toxB, katP, toxB). The isolates were also characterized by use of a pathogenicity molecular risk assessment (MRA; based on the presence of various O-island nle genes). Results of this characterization identified 10 STEC isolates (0.24\% of the 4,133 total) that may be considered a significant food safety threat, defined by the presence of eae, subA, and nle genes.},

	abstract = {Escherichia coli serogroup O26 consists of enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) and atypical enteropathogenic E. coli (aEPEC). The former produces Shiga toxins (Stx), major determinants of EHEC pathogenicity, encoded by bacteriophages; the latter is Stx negative. We have isolated EHEC O26 from patient stools early in illness and aEPEC O26 from stools later in illness, and vice versa. Intrapatient EHEC and aEPEC isolates had quite similar pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns, suggesting that they might have arisen by conversion between the EHEC and aEPEC pathotypes during infection. To test this hypothesis, we asked whether EHEC O26 can lose stx genes and whether aEPEC O26 can be lysogenized with Stx-encoding phages from EHEC O26 in vitro. The stx2 loss associated with the loss of Stx2-encoding phages occurred in 10\% to 14\% of colonies tested. Conversely, Stx2- and, to a lesser extent, Stx1-encoding bacteriophages from EHEC O26 lysogenized aEPEC O26 isolates, converting them to EHEC strains. In the lysogens and EHEC O26 donors, Stx2-converting bacteriophages integrated in yecE or wrbA. The loss and gain of Stx-converting bacteriophages diversifies PFGE patterns; this parallels findings of similar but not identical PFGE patterns in the intrapatient EHEC and aEPEC O26 isolates. EHEC O26 and aEPEC O26 thus exist as a dynamic system whose members undergo ephemeral interconversions via loss and gain of Stx-encoding phages to yield different pathotypes. The suggested occurrence of this process in the human intestine has diagnostic, clinical, epidemiological, and evolutionary implications.},

	abstract = {Of 220 Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) strains collected in central France from healthy cattle, food samples, and asymptomatic children, 12 possessed the eae gene included in the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island. Based on gene typing, we observed 7 different eae espA espB tir pathotypes among the 12 STEC strains and described the new espAbetav variant. As previously observed, the O157 serogroup is associated with eaegamma, O26 is associated with eaebeta, and O103 is associated with eaeepsilon. However, the unexpected eaezeta allele was detected in 5 of the 12 isolates. PCR amplification and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis using the I-CeuI endonuclease followed by Southern hybridization indicated that the LEE was inserted in the vicinity of the selC (three isolates), pheU (two isolates), or pheV (six isolates) tRNA gene. Six isolates harbored two or three of these tRNA loci altered by the insertion of integrase genes (CP4-int and/or int-phe), suggesting the insertion of additional foreign DNA fragments at these sites. In spite of great genetic diversity of LEE pathotypes and LEE insertion sites, bovine strains harbor alleles of LEE genes that are frequently found in clinical STEC strains isolated from outbreaks and sporadic cases around the world, underscoring the potential risk of the bovine strains on human health.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Escherichia coli is a model prokaryote, an important pathogen, and a key organism for industrial biotechnology. E. coli W (ATCC 9637), one of four strains designated as safe for laboratory purposes, has not been sequenced. E. coli W is a fast-growing strain and is the only safe strain that can utilize sucrose as a carbon source. Lifecycle analysis has demonstrated that sucrose from sugarcane is a preferred carbon source for industrial bioprocesses.
RESULTS: We have sequenced and annotated the genome of E. coli W. The chromosome is 4,900,968 bp and encodes 4,764 ORFs. Two plasmids, pRK1 (102,536 bp) and pRK2 (5,360 bp), are also present. W has unique features relative to other sequenced laboratory strains (K-12, B and Crooks): it has a larger genome and belongs to phylogroup B1 rather than A. W also grows on a much broader range of carbon sources than does K-12. A genome-scale reconstruction was developed and validated in order to interrogate metabolic properties.
CONCLUSIONS: The genome of W is more similar to commensal and pathogenic B1 strains than phylogroup A strains, and therefore has greater utility for comparative analyses with these strains. W should therefore be the strain of choice, or 'type strain' for group B1 comparative analyses. The genome annotation and tools created here are expected to allow further utilization and development of E. coli W as an industrial organism for sucrose-based bioprocesses. Refinements in our E. coli metabolic reconstruction allow it to more accurately define E. coli metabolism relative to previous models.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2164-10-296},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evolutionary analyses of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) have identified two distantly related clonal groups: EHEC 1, including serotype O157:H7 and its inferred ancestor O55:H7; and EHEC 2, comprised of several serogroups (O26, O111, O118, etc.). These two clonal groups differ in their virulence and global distribution. Although several fully annotated genomic sequences exist for strains of serotype O157:H7, much less is known about the genomic composition of EHEC 2. In this study, we analyzed a set of 24 clinical EHEC 2 strains representing serotypes O26:H11, O111:H8/H11, O118:H16, O153:H11 and O15:H11 from humans and animals by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) on an oligoarray based on the O157:H7 Sakai genome.
RESULTS: Backbone genes, defined as genes shared by Sakai and K-12, were highly conserved in EHEC 2. The proportion of Sakai phage genes in EHEC 2 was substantially greater than that of Sakai-specific bacterial (non-phage) genes. This proportion was inverted in O55:H7, reiterating that a subset of Sakai bacterial genes is specific to EHEC 1. Split decomposition analysis of gene content revealed that O111:H8 was more genetically uniform and distinct from other EHEC 2 strains, with respect to the Sakai O157:H7 gene distribution. Serotype O26:H11 was the most heterogeneous EHEC 2 subpopulation, comprised of strains with the highest as well as the lowest levels of Sakai gene content conservation. Of the 979 parsimoniously informative genes, 15\% were found to be compatible and their distribution in EHEC 2 clustered O111:H8 and O118:H16 strains by serotype. CGH data suggested divergence of the LEE island from the LEE1 to the LEE4 operon, and also between animal and human isolates irrespective of serotype. No correlation was found between gene contents and geographic locations of EHEC 2 strains.
CONCLUSION: The gene content variation of phage-related genes in EHEC 2 strains supports the hypothesis that extensive modular shuffling of mobile DNA elements has occurred among EHEC strains. These results suggest that EHEC 2 is a multiform pathogenic clonal complex, characterized by substantial intra-serotype genetic variation. The heterogeneous distribution of mobile elements has impacted the diversification of O26:H11 more than other EHEC 2 serotypes.},

Campylobacter is a common cause of human gastroenteritis as a consequence of its proliferation in multiple farm animal species and its transmission via contaminated meat and poultry. We applied our association mapping method to identify the factors responsible for adaptation to cattle and chickens among 192 Campylobacter isolates from these and other host sources. Phylogenetic analysis implied frequent host switching but also showed that some lineages were strongly associated with particular hosts. A seven-gene region with a host association signal was found. Genes in this region were almost universally present in cattle but were frequently absent in isolates from chickens and wild birds. Three of the seven genes encoded vitamin B5 biosynthesis. We found that isolates from cattle were better able to grow in vitamin B5-depleted media and propose that this difference may be an adaptation to host diet.},

	abstract = {Temperate bacteriophages have always been central to the evolution of bacteria, although their importance has been consistently underestimated compared to transformation and conjugation. In the last 20 years, as more gene and genome sequences have become available and researchers have more accurately determined bacteriophage populations in the environment, we are gaining a clearer picture of their role in the past and potential role in the future. The transductive and lysogenic capacities of this class of bacteriophages have contributed to the evolution and shaping of emerging foodborne pathogenic bacteria through the dissemination of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes. For example, the genome sequences of Shigella dysenteriae, Escherichia coli O157:H7, and the Stxencoding bacteriophages demonstrate the critical role bacteriophage-mediated gene transfer events played in the evolution of these high-profile human pathogens. In this review, we describe the basic genetic exchange mechanisms mediated by temperate bacteriophages and how these mechanisms have been central to the dissemination of virulence genes, such as toxins and antibiotics from one species to another (the shiga-like toxins, and multiple antibiotic resistance dissemination in Salmonella are used as specific examples). Data demonstrating the role of bacteriophages in the spread of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria, including interspecies transduction, are also presented. That temperate bacteriophages play a role in the on-going evolution of emerging pathogenic bacteria is obvious, but it is also clearly an on-going process with a breadth that must be appreciated as well as studied further if we are to be able to foresee what new challenges will arise to imperil food safety.},

The set included 263 natural E. coli isolates exposed to various environments and isolated over a 20-year period from humans and animals, as well as 27 fully sequenced strains. Our analyses confirm that there are two largely independent pairs of CRISPR loci (CRISPR1 and -2 and CRISPR3 and -4), each associated with a different type of cas genes (Ecoli and Ypest, respectively), but that each pair of CRISPRs has similar dynamics. Strikingly, the major phylogenetic group B2 is almost devoid of CRISPRs. The majority of genomes analyzed lack Ypest cas genes and contain CRISPR3 with spacers matching Ypest cas genes. The analysis of relatedness between strains in terms of spacer repertoire and the MLST tree shows a pattern where closely related strains (MLST phylogenetic distance of {\textless}0.005 corresponding to at least hundreds of thousands of years) often exhibit identical CRISPRs while more distantly related strains (MLST distance of {\textgreater}0.01) exhibit completely different CRISPRs. This suggests rare but radical turnover of spacers in CRISPRs rather than CRISPR gradual change. We found no link between the presence, size, or content of CRISPRs and the lifestyle of the strains. Our data suggest that, within the E. coli species, CRISPRs do not have the expected characteristics of a classical immune system.},

We have exploited bioinformatics and experimental approaches to establish that the effector repertoire in the Sakai strain of enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) O157:H7 is much larger than previously thought. Homology searches led to the identification of {\textgreater}60 putative effector genes. Thirteen of these were judged to be likely pseudogenes, whereas 49 were judged to be potentially functional. In total, 39 proteins were confirmed experimentally as effectors: 31 through proteomics and 28 through translocation assays. At the protein level, the EHEC effector sequences fall into {\textgreater}20 families. The largest family, the NleG family, contains 14 members in the Sakai strain alone. EHEC also harbors functional homologs of effectors from plant pathogens (HopPtoH, HopW, AvrA) and from Shigella (OspD, OspE, OspG), and two additional members of the Map/IpgB family. Genes encoding proven or predicted effectors occur in {\textgreater}20 exchangeable effector loci scattered throughout the chromosome. Crucially, the majority of functional effector genes are encoded by nine exchangeable effector loci that lie within lambdoid prophages. Thus, type III secretion in E. coli is linked to a vast phage "metagenome," acting as a crucible for the evolution of pathogenicity.},

To elucidate the evolution of pathogenic Escherichia coli strains, here we sequenced seven housekeeping genes to build a phylogenetic tree and trace the history of the acquisition of virulence genes. Compatibility analysis indicates that more than 70\% of the informative sites agree with a single phylogeny, suggesting that recombination has not completely obscured the remnants of ancestral chromosomes. On the basis of the rate of synonymous substitution for E. coli and Salmonella enterica (4.7 x 10(-9) per site per year), the radiation of clones began about 9 million years ago and the highly virulent pathogen responsible for epidemics of food poisoning, E. coli O157:H7, separated from a common ancestor of E. coli K-12 as long as 4.5 million years ago. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that old lineages of E. coli have acquired the same virulence factors in parallel, including a pathogenicity island involved in intestinal adhesion, a plasmid-borne haemolysin, and phage-encoded Shiga toxins. Such parallel evolution indicates that natural selection has favoured an ordered acquisition of genes and the progressive build-up of molecular mechanisms that increase virulence.},

Different plasmids carry segments that align to different parts of the blaNDM region found on Acinetobacter plasmids. pKP1-NDM-1 and pEC2-NDM-3, from Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, respectively, were identified as type 1 IncA/C2 plasmids with almost identical backbones. Different regions carrying blaNDM are inserted in different locations in the antibiotic resistance island known as ARI-A, and ISCR1 may have been involved in the acquisition of blaNDM-3 by pEC2-NDM-3. pECL3-NDM-1 and pEC4-NDM-6, from Enterobacter cloacae and E. coli, respectively, have similar IncFIIY backbones, but different regions carrying blaNDM are found in different locations. Tn3-derived inverted-repeat transposable elements (TIME) appear to have been involved in the acquisition of blaNDM-6 by pEC4-NDM-6 and the rmtC 16S rRNA methylase gene by IncFIIY plasmids. Characterization of these plasmids further demonstrates that even very closely related plasmids may have acquired blaNDM genes by different mechanisms. These findings also illustrate the complex relationships between antimicrobial resistance genes, transposable elements, and plasmids and provide insights into the possible routes for transmission of blaNDM genes among species of the Enterobacteriaceae family.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Visualisation of genome comparisons is invaluable for helping to determine genotypic differences between closely related prokaryotes. New visualisation and abstraction methods are required in order to improve the validation, interpretation and communication of genome sequence information; especially with the increasing amount of data arising from next-generation sequencing projects. Visualising a prokaryote genome as a circular image has become a powerful means of displaying informative comparisons of one genome to a number of others. Several programs, imaging libraries and internet resources already exist for this purpose, however, most are either limited in the number of comparisons they can show, are unable to adequately utilise draft genome sequence data, or require a knowledge of command-line scripting for implementation. Currently, there is no freely available desktop application that enables users to rapidly visualise comparisons between hundreds of draft or complete genomes in a single image.
RESULTS: BLAST Ring Image Generator (BRIG) can generate images that show multiple prokaryote genome comparisons, without an arbitrary limit on the number of genomes compared. The output image shows similarity between a central reference sequence and other sequences as a set of concentric rings, where BLAST matches are coloured on a sliding scale indicating a defined percentage identity. Images can also include draft genome assembly information to show read coverage, assembly breakpoints and collapsed repeats. In addition, BRIG supports the mapping of unassembled sequencing reads against one or more central reference sequences. Many types of custom data and annotations can be shown using BRIG, making it a versatile approach for visualising a range of genomic comparison data. BRIG is readily accessible to any user, as it assumes no specialist computational knowledge and will perform all required file parsing and BLAST comparisons automatically.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a clear need for a user-friendly program that can produce genome comparisons for a large number of prokaryote genomes with an emphasis on rapidly utilising unfinished or unassembled genome data. Here we present BRIG, a cross-platform application that enables the interactive generation of comparative genomic images via a simple graphical-user interface.

One extreme of UTI is asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU), which occurs as an asymptomatic carrier state that resembles commensalism. To understand the evolution and molecular mechanisms that underpin ABU, the genome of the ABU E. coli strain VR50 was sequenced. Analysis of the complete genome indicated that it most resembles E. coli K-12, with the addition of a 94-kb genomic island (GI-VR50-pheV), eight prophages, and multiple plasmids. GI-VR50-pheV has a mosaic structure and contains genes encoding a number of UTI-associated virulence factors, namely, Afa (afimbrial adhesin), two autotransporter proteins (Ag43 and Sat), and aerobactin. We demonstrated that the presence of this island in VR50 confers its ability to colonize the murine bladder, as a VR50 mutant with GI-VR50-pheV deleted was attenuated in a mouse model of UTI in vivo. We established that Afa is the island-encoded factor responsible for this phenotype using two independent deletion (Afa operon and AfaE adhesin) mutants. E. coli VR50afa and VR50afaE displayed significantly decreased ability to adhere to human bladder epithelial cells. In the mouse model of UTI, VR50afa and VR50afaE displayed reduced bladder colonization compared to wild-type VR50, similar to the colonization level of the GI-VR50-pheV mutant. Our study suggests that E. coli VR50 is a commensal-like strain that has acquired fitness factors that facilitate colonization of the human bladder.},

As food is increasingly distributed across borders, such outbreaks are becoming more common. This increases the need for high-resolution, accessible, and replicable isolate typing schemes. Here we evaluate a core genome multilocus typing (cgMLST) scheme for the high-resolution reproducible typing of Salmonella enterica (S. enterica) isolates, by its application to a large European outbreak of S. enterica serovar Enteritidis. This outbreak had been extensively characterised using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based approaches. The cgMLST analysis was congruent with the original SNP-based analysis, the epidemiological data, and whole genome MLST (wgMLST) analysis. Combination of the cgMLST and epidemiological data confirmed that the genetic diversity among the isolates predated the outbreak, and was likely present at the infection source. There was consequently no link between country of isolation and genetic diversity, but the cgMLST clusters were congruent with date of isolation. Furthermore, comparison with publicly available Enteritidis isolate data demonstrated that the cgMLST scheme presented is highly scalable, enabling outbreaks to be contextualised within the Salmonella genus. The cgMLST scheme is therefore shown to be a standardised and scalable typing method, which allows Salmonella outbreaks to be analysed and compared across laboratories and jurisdictions.},

	abstract = {For many decades, Salmonella enterica has been subdivided by serological properties into serovars or further subdivided for epidemiological tracing by a variety of diagnostic tests with higher resolution. Recently, it has been proposed that so-called eBurst groups (eBGs) based on the alleles of seven housekeeping genes (legacy multilocus sequence typing [MLST]) corresponded to natural populations and could replace serotyping. However, this approach lacks the resolution needed for epidemiological tracing and the existence of natural populations had not been independently validated by independent criteria. Here, we describe EnteroBase, a web-based platform that assembles draft genomes from Illumina short reads in the public domain or that are uploaded by users. EnteroBase implements legacy MLST as well as ribosomal gene MLST (rMLST), core genome MLST (cgMLST), and whole genome MLST (wgMLST) and currently contains over 100,000 assembled genomes from Salmonella. It also provides graphical tools for visual interrogation of these genotypes and those based on core single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). eBGs based on legacy MLST are largely consistent with eBGs based on rMLST, thus demonstrating that these correspond to natural populations. rMLST also facilitated the selection of representative genotypes for SNP analyses of the entire breadth of diversity within Salmonella. In contrast, cgMLST provides the resolution needed for epidemiological investigations. These observations show that genomic genotyping, with the assistance of EnteroBase, can be applied at all levels of diversity within the Salmonella genus.},

Here, we describe a draft Paratyphi C genome (Ragna) recovered from the 800-year-old skeleton (SK152) of a young woman in Trondheim, Norway. Paratyphi C sequences were recovered from her teeth and bones, suggesting that she died of enteric fever and demonstrating that these bacteria have long caused invasive salmonellosis in Europeans. Comparative analyses against modern Salmonella genome sequences revealed that Paratyphi C is a clade within the Para C lineage, which also includes serovars Choleraesuis, Typhisuis, and Lomita. Although Paratyphi C only infects humans, Choleraesuis causes septicemia in pigs and boar [5] (and occasionally humans), and Typhisuis causes epidemic swine salmonellosis (chronic paratyphoid) in domestic pigs [2, 3]. These different host specificities likely evolved in Europe over the last ∼4,000 years since the time of their most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) and are possibly associated with the differential acquisitions of two genomic islands, SPI-6 and SPI-7. The tMRCAs of these bacterial clades coincide with the timing of pig domestication in Europe [6].},

Among these, Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) are unique in providing adaptive immunity against elements with high local resemblance to genomes of previously infecting agents. Here, we analyze the CRISPR loci of 51 complete genomes of Escherichia and Salmonella. CRISPR are in two pairs of loci in Escherichia, one single pair in Salmonella, each pair showing a similar turnover rate, repeat sequence and putative linkage to a common set of cas genes. Yet, phylogeny shows that CRISPR and associated cas genes have different evolutionary histories, the latter being frequently exchanged or lost. In our set, one CRISPR pair seems specialized in plasmids often matching genes coding for the replication, conjugation and antirestriction machinery. Strikingly, this pair also matches the cognate cas genes in which case these genes are absent. The unexpectedly high conservation of this anti-CRISPR suggests selection to counteract the invasion of mobile elements containing functional CRISPR/cas systems. There are few spacers in most CRISPR, which rarely match genomes of known phages. Furthermore, we found that strains divergent less than 250 thousand years ago show virtually identical CRISPR. The lack of congruence between cas, CRISPR and the species phylogeny and the slow pace of CRISPR change make CRISPR poor epidemiological markers in enterobacteria. All these observations are at odds with the expectedly abundant and dynamic repertoire of spacers in an immune system aiming at protecting bacteria from phages. Since we observe purifying selection for the maintenance of CRISPR these results suggest that alternative evolutionary roles for CRISPR remain to be uncovered.},

Comparative analyses of Escherichia and Shigella genome sequences revealed that the ETT2 gene cluster is larger than was previously thought, encompassing homologues of genes from the Spi-1, Spi-2, and Spi-3 Salmonella pathogenicity islands. ETT2-associated genes, including regulators and chaperones, were found at the same chromosomal location in the majority of genome-sequenced strains, including the laboratory strain K-12. Using a PCR-based approach, we constructed a complete tiling path through the ETT2 gene cluster for 79 strains, including the well-characterized E. coli reference collection supplemented with additional pathotypes. The ETT2 gene cluster was found to be present in whole or in part in the majority of E. coli strains, whether pathogenic or commensal, with patterns of distribution and deletion mirroring the known phylogenetic structure of the species. In almost all strains, including enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7, ETT2 has been subjected to varying degrees of mutational attrition that render it unable to encode a functioning secretion system. A second type III secretion system-associated locus that likely encodes the ETT2 translocation apparatus was found in some E. coli strains. Intact versions of both ETT2-related clusters are apparently present in enteroaggregative E. coli strain O42.},

Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica each have many forms of O antigen, but only three are common to the two species. It has been found that, in general, O-antigen genes are of low GC content. This deviation in GC content from that of typical S. enterica or E. coli genes (51\%) is thought to indicate that the O-antigen DNA originated in species other than S. enterica or E. coli and was captured by lateral transfer. The O-antigen structure of Salmonella enterica O35 is identical to that of E. coli O111, commonly found in enteropathogenic E. coli strains. This O antigen, which has been shown to be a virulence factor in E. coli, contains colitose, a 3,6-dideoxyhexose found only rarely in the Enterobacteriaceae. Sequencing of the O35-antigen gene cluster of S. enterica serovar Adelaide revealed the same gene order and flanking genes as in E. coli O111. The divergence between corresponding genes of these two gene clusters at the nucleotide level ranges from 21.8 to 11.7\%, within the normal range of divergence between S. enterica and E. coli. We conclude that the ancestor of E. coli and S. enterica had an O antigen identical to the O111 and O35 antigens, respectively, of these species and that the gene cluster encoding it has survived in both species.},

It is used extensively, taking advantage of properties such as high DNA transformation efficiency and maintenance of large plasmids. The strain was constructed by serial genetic recombination steps, but the underlying sequence changes remained unverified. We report the complete genomic sequence of DH10B by using reads accumulated from the bovine sequencing project at Baylor College of Medicine and assembled with DNAStar's SeqMan genome assembler. The DH10B genome is largely colinear with that of the wild-type K-12 strain MG1655, although it is substantially more complex than previously appreciated, allowing DH10B biology to be further explored. The 226 mutated genes in DH10B relative to MG1655 are mostly attributable to the extensive genetic manipulations the strain has undergone. However, we demonstrate that DH10B has a 13.5-fold higher mutation rate than MG1655, resulting from a dramatic increase in insertion sequence (IS) transposition, especially IS150. IS elements appear to have remodeled genome architecture, providing homologous recombination sites for a 113,260-bp tandem duplication and an inversion. DH10B requires leucine for growth on minimal medium due to the deletion of leuLABCD and harbors both the relA1 and spoT1 alleles causing both sensitivity to nutritional downshifts and slightly lower growth rates relative to the wild type. Finally, while the sequence confirms most of the reported alleles, the sequence of deoR is wild type, necessitating reexamination of the assumed basis for the high transformability of DH10B.},

To clarify the emergence of LEE-negative STEC, we compared the genetic composition of the virulence plasmids pO113 and pO157 from LEE-negative and LEE-positive STEC, respectively. The complete nucleotide sequence of pO113 showed that several plasmid genes were shared by STEC O157:H7. In addition, allelic profiling of the ehxA gene demonstrated that pO113 belongs to a different evolutionary lineage than pO157 and that the virulence plasmids of LEE-negative STEC strains were highly related.

Except PAI IV(536), the four other PAIs of strain 536 are flanked by direct repeats (DRs), carry intact integrase genes and are able to excise site-specifically from the chromosome. Genome screening of strain 536 identified a sixth putative asnW-associated PAI. Despite the presence of DRs and an intact integrase gene, excision of this island was not detected. To investigate the role of PAI-encoded integrases for the recombination process the int genes of each unstable island of strain 536 were inactivated. For PAI I(536) and PAI II(536), their respective P4-like integrase was required for their excision. PAI III(536) carries two integrase genes, intA, encoding an SfX-like integrase, and intB, coding for an integrase with weak similarity to P4-like integrases. Only intB was required for site-specific excision of this island. For PAI V(536), excision could not be abolished after deleting its P4-like integrase gene but additional deletion of the PAI II(536)-specific integrase gene was required. Therefore, although all mediated by P4-like integrases, the activity of the PAI excision machinery is most often restricted to its cognate island. This work also demonstrates for the first time the existence of a cross-talk between integrases of different PAIs and shows that this cross-talk is unidirectional.},

Here we sequence the genomes of 14 isolates of a uropathogenic E. coli clone that persisted for 3 years within a household, including a dog, causing a urinary tract infection (UTI) in the dog after 2 years. The 20 mutations observed fit a single tree that allows us to estimate the mutation rate to be about 1.1 per genome per year, with minimal evidence for adaptive change, including in relation to the UTI episode. The host data also imply at least 6 host transfer events over the 3 years, with 2 lineages present over much of that period. To our knowledge, these are the first direct measurements for a clone in a well-defined host community that includes rates of mutation and host transmission. There is a concentration of non-synonymous mutations associated with 2 transfers to the dog, suggesting some selection pressure from the change of host. However, there are no changes to which we can attribute the UTI event in the dog, which suggests that this occurrence after 2 years of the clone being in the household may have been due to chance, or some unknown change in the host or environment. The ability of a UTI strain to persist for 2 years and also to transfer readily within a household has implications for epidemiology, diagnosis, and clinical intervention.},

	abstract = {Stx2d is a recently described Shiga toxin whose cytotoxicity is activated 10- to 1000-fold by the elastase present in mouse or human intestinal mucus. We examined Shiga toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC) strains isolated from food and livestock sources for the presence of activatable stx(2d). The stx(2) operons of STEC were first analyzed by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and categorized as stx(2), stx(2c vha), stx(2c vhb), or stx(2d EH250). Subsequently, the stx(2c vha) and stx(2c vhb) operons were screened for the absence of a PstI site in the stx(2A) subunit gene, a restriction site polymorphism which is a predictive indicator for the stx(2d) (activatable) genotype. Twelve STEC isolates carrying putative stx(2d) operons were identified, and nucleotide sequencing was used to confirm the identification of these operons as stx(2d). The complete nucleotide sequences of seven representative stx(2d) operons were determined. Shiga toxin expression in stx(2d) isolates was confirmed by immunoblotting. stx(2d) isolates were induced for the production of bacteriophages carrying stx. Two isolates were able to produce bacteriophages phi1662a and phi1720a carrying the stx(2d) operons. RFLP analysis of bacteriophage genomic DNA revealed that phi1662a and phi1720a were highly related to each other; however, the DNA sequences of these two stx(2d) operons were distinct. The STEC strains carrying these operons were isolated from retail ground beef. Surveillance for STEC strains expressing activatable Stx2d Shiga toxin among clinical cases may indicate the significance of this toxin subtype to human health.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sequencing of prokaryotic genomes has recently revealed the presence of CRISPR elements: short, highly conserved repeats separated by unique sequences of similar length. The distinctive sequence signature of CRISPR repeats can be found using general-purpose repeat- or pattern-finding software tools. However, the output of such tools is not always ideal for studying these repeats, and significant effort is sometimes needed to build additional tools and perform manual analysis of the output.
RESULTS: We present PILER-CR, a program specifically designed for the identification and analysis of CRISPR repeats. The program executes rapidly, completing a 5 Mb genome in around 5 seconds on a current desktop computer. We validate the algorithm by manual curation and by comparison with published surveys of these repeats, finding that PILER-CR has both high sensitivity and high specificity. We also present a catalogue of putative CRISPR repeats identified in a comprehensive analysis of 346 prokaryotic genomes.
CONCLUSION: PILER-CR is a useful tool for rapid identification and classification of CRISPR repeats. The software is donated to the public domain. Source code and a Linux binary are freely available at http://www.drive5.com/pilercr.},

	abstract = {Escherichia coli is a diverse bacterial species which is widely distributed in the environment but also exists as a commensal and pathogen of different host species. Human intestinal pathogenic E. coli causes over 160 million cases of diarrhea and an estimated 1 million deaths per year. The majority of deaths are attributable to one pathovar of E. coli, namely, enterotoxigenic E. coli. The pathogenesis of enterotoxigenic E. coli is dependent on the production of a colonization factor to promote adhesion to the intestinal epithelium and the elaboration of heat-labile or heat-stable toxins which induce a secretory diarrhea. Despite the high morbidity and mortality associated with enterotoxigenic E. coli infection, little is known of the genetic background of this global pathogen. Here we demonstrate by multilocus sequence typing that enterotoxigenic E. coli isolates are present in all phylogenetic lineages of E. coli, indicating that acquisition of the toxin genes may be sufficient to generate an enterotoxigenic E. coli strain. In addition, screening of diarrheal isolates for the presence of additional genes previously associated with the virulence of enterotoxigenic E. coli revealed that they were not abundant. These observations have significant implications for disease epidemiology and for the design of effective vaccines.},

The products responsible for O-antigen synthesis are encoded in the wbe region, which exhibits extensive genetic diversity. While heterogeneous O-antigens are observed within Vibrio species, characterization of these structures has been devoted almost exclusively to pathogens. Here, we investigate O-antigen diversity among coastal marine Vibrio splendidus-like isolates. The wbe region was first identified and characterized using the sequenced genomes of strains LGP32, 12B01 and Med222. These regions were genetically diverse, reflective of their expressed O-antigen. Additional isolates from physically distinct habitats in Plum Island Estuary (MA, USA), including within animal hosts and on suspended particles, were further characterized based on multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) and O-antigen profiles. Results showed serotype diversity within an ecological setting. Among 48 isolates which were identical in three MLSA genes, 41 showed gpm genetic diversity, a gene closely linked to the wbe locus, and at least 12 expressed different O-antigen profiles further suggesting wbe genetic diversity. Our results demonstrate O-antigen hyper-variability among these environmental strains and suggest that frequent lateral gene transfer generates wbe extensive diversity among V. splendidus and its close relatives.},

	abstract = {Intimin is an important virulence factor in two groups of enteric pathogens: enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), which is a major cause of infant diarrhea in the developing world, and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), which has caused large food-borne outbreaks of hemorrhagic colitis in the United States and other developed countries. Intimin is encoded on a 35-kb pathogenicity island called the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE). At least five antigenic types have been described for the highly variable gene, and each type is generally characteristic of particular evolutionary lineages. We determined the nucleotide sequences of intimin and other LEE genes in two O111 clones that have not been amenable to typing. The sequences from both O111:H8 and O111:H9 differed from the Int-beta that is typical of other clones in the same evolutionary lineage. The sequence from the O111:H8 strains was a mosaic of divergent segments that alternately clustered with Int-alpha, Int-beta, or Int-gamma. The sequence from the O111:H9 clone consistently showed a close relationship with that from E2348/69, a distantly related strain that expresses Int-alpha. The results suggest that there have been multiple acquisitions of the LEE in the EHEC 2/EPEC 2 clonal lineage, with a recent turnover in either O111:H8 or its close relatives. Amino acid substitutions that alter residue charge occurred more frequently than would be expected under random substitution in the extracellular domains of intimin, suggesting that diversifying selection has promoted divergence in this region of the protein. An N-terminal domain that presumably functions in the periplasm may also be under positive selection.},

STEC O103:non-H2 strains are also sometimes isolated from human patients, but their genetic characteristics and role in significant human enteric disease are not yet understood. Here, we investigated 17 STEC O103:non-H2 strains, including O103:H11, O103:H25, O103:HUT (UT [untypeable]), and O103:H- (nonmotile) isolated in Japan, and their characteristics were compared to those of STEC O103:H2 and other serotype STEC strains. Sequence analyses of fliC and eae genes revealed that strains possessed any of the following combinations: fliC-H2/eae-epsilon, fliC-H11/eae-beta1, and fliC-H25/eae-theta, where fliC-H2, -H11, and -H25 indicate fliC genes encoding H2, H11, and H25 flagella antigens, respectively, and eae-epsilon, -beta1, and -theta indicate eae genes encoding epsilon, beta1, and theta subclass intimins, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on the sequences of seven housekeeping genes demonstrated that the O103:H11/[fliC-H11] and O103:H25/[fliC-H25] strains formed two distinct groups, different from that of the O103:H2/[fliC-H2] strains. Interestingly, a group consisting of O103:H11 strains was closely related to STEC O26:H11, which is recognized as a most important non-O157 serotype, suggesting that the STEC O103:H11 and STEC O26:H11 clones evolved from a common ancestor. The multiplex PCR system for the rapid typing of STEC O103 strains described in the present study may aid clinical and epidemiological studies of the STEC O103:H2, O103:H11, and O103:H25 groups.

A total of 56 isolates from humans, farm animals, and food were subjected to multilocus virulence gene profiling (MVGP), and a subset of 16 isolates was subjected to multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA). The MLSA revealed that the O174 isolates fall into four separate evolutionary clusters within the E. coli phylogeny and are related to a diverse array of clonal groups, including enteropathogenic E. coli 2 (EPEC 2), enterohemorrhagic E. coli 2 (EHEC 2), and EHEC-O121. Of the 15 genes that we surveyed with MVGP, only 6 are common in the O174 strains. The different clonal groups within the O174 serogroup appear to have independently acquired and maintained similar sets of genes that include the Shiga toxins (stx1 and stx2) and two adhesins (saa and iha). The absence of certain O island (OI) genes, such as those found on OI-122, is consistent with the notion that certain pathogenicity islands act cooperatively with the LEE island.},

The O121:H19 serotype is being isolated more frequently from clinical specimens and has been implicated in one waterborne outbreak. We used multilocus virulence gene profiling, a PCR-based assay, to characterize the virulence gene content of 24 isolates of serotype O121:H19 and nonmotile variants. We also performed multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and multilocus sequencing to establish the clonal relatedness of O121 isolates and to elucidate the relationship of O121 to common STEC clones. The 24 isolates were found to represent a single bacterial clone, as there was no allelic variation across 18 enzyme loci among the isolates. The complete nucleotide sequence of the intimin gene differed by four substitutions from that of the epsilon (Int- epsilon ) allele of O103:H2 strain PMK5. The typical O121 virulence gene profile was similar to the profiles of enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) clones of E. coli: it included a Shiga toxin 2 gene (stx(2)), two genes on the EHEC plasmid (toxB and ehxA), and the gene encoding intimin (eae). Despite the similarities, putative virulence genes distributed on O islands-large chromosomal DNA segments present in the O157:H7 genome-were useful for discriminating among STEC serotypes and the O121:H19 clone had a composite profile that was distinct from the profiles of the other major EHEC clones of pathogenic E. coli. On the basis of sequencing analysis with 13 housekeeping genes, the O121:H19 clone did not fall into any of the four classical EHEC and enteropathogenic E. coli groups but instead was closely related to two eae-negative STEC strains.},

We have previously shown that lineage I as a group expresses higher levels of Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2) than lineage II. To help evaluate why lineage II strains do not express appreciable levels of this toxin, whole-genome microarrays were performed using Agilent custom microarrays. Gene expression of the two representative bovine lineage II strains (FRIK966 and FRIK2000) were compared with gene expression of E. coli O157:H7 EDL933 (lineage I clinical type strain). Missing or differentially expressed genes and pathways were identified. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed to validate the microarray data. Draft genomes of FRIK966 and FRIK2000 were sequenced using Roche Applied Science/454 GS-FLX technology shotgun and paired-end approaches followed by de novo assembly. These assemblies were compared with the lineage I genome sequences from E. coli O157:H7 EDL933. The bacteriophage 933W, which encodes the Stx2 genes, showed a notable repression in gene expression. Polymerase chain reaction primers, based upon EDL933 genomic information, were also designed against all of the potentially missing genes of this bacteriophage. Most of the structural genes associated with the bacteriophage were found to be absent from the genome of the two bovine strains. These analyses, combined with evaluation of the genomic information, suggest that transposon (IS629) rearrangements may be associated with disruption of the bacteriophage genome in the FRIK strains. The results support the hypothesis that lineage II strains may be less of a risk as human foodborne pathogens. The microarray and genome data have been made available to the scientific community to allow continuing analysis of these cattle-isolated lineage II genomes and their gene expression.},

Two cosmids from an E. coli O157:H7 DNA library contain an adherence-conferring chromosomal gene encoding a protein similar to iron-regulated gene A (IrgA) of Vibrio cholerae (M. B. Goldberg, S. A. Boyko, J. R. Butterton, J. A. Stoebner, S. M. Payne, and S. B. Calderwood, Mol. Microbiol. 6:2407-2418, 1992). We have termed the product of this gene the IrgA homologue adhesin (Iha), which is encoded by iha. Iha is 67 kDa in E. coli O157:H7 and 78 kDa in laboratory E. coli and is structurally unlike other known adhesins. DNA adjacent to iha contains tellurite resistance loci and is conserved in structure in distantly related pathogenic E. coli, but it is absent from nontoxigenic E. coli O55:H7, sorbitol-fermenting Stx-producing E. coli O157:H-, and laboratory E. coli. We have termed this region the tellurite resistance- and adherence-conferring island. We conclude that Iha is a novel bacterial adherence-conferring protein and is contained within an E. coli chromosomal island of conserved structure.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) are an important cause of diarrhea and the major cause of postdiarrheal hemolytic uremic syndrome. Non-O157 STEC infections are being recognized with greater frequency because of changing laboratory practices.
METHODS: Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) site staff conducted active, population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed STEC infections. We assessed frequency and incidence of STEC infections by serogroup and examined and compared demographic factors, clinical characteristics, and frequency of international travel among patients.
RESULTS: During 2000-2010, FoodNet sites reported 2006 cases of non-O157 STEC infection and 5688 cases of O157 STEC infections. The number of reported non-O157 STEC infections increased from an incidence of 0.12 per 100,000 population in 2000 to 0.95 per 100,000 in 2010; while the rate of O157 STEC infections decreased from 2.17 to 0.95 per 100,000. Among non-O157 STEC, six serogroups were most commonly reported: O26 (26\%), O103 (22\%), O111 (19\%), O121 (6\%), O45 (5\%), and O145 (4\%). Non-O157 STEC infections were more common among Hispanics, and infections were less severe than those caused by O157 STEC, but this varied by serogroup. Fewer non-O157 STEC infections were associated with outbreaks (7\% versus 20\% for O157), while more were associated with international travel (14\% versus 3\% for O157).
CONCLUSIONS: Improved understanding of the epidemiologic features of non-O157 STEC infections can inform food safety and other prevention efforts. To detect both O157 and non-O157 STEC infections, clinical laboratories should routinely and simultaneously test all stool specimens submitted for diagnosis of acute community-acquired diarrhea for O157 STEC and for Shiga toxin and ensure that isolates are sent to a public health laboratory for serotyping and subtyping.},

Aimed at a better understanding of the evolution of the E. coli O157:H7 pathogenome, the present study presents the high-quality sequencing and comparative phylogenomic analysis of a comprehensive panel of 25 E. coli O157:H7 strains associated with three nearly simultaneous food-borne outbreaks of human disease in the United States. Here we present a population genetic analysis of more than 200 related strains recovered from patients, contaminated produce, and zoonotic sources. High-resolution phylogenomic approaches allow the dynamics of pathogenome evolution to be followed at a high level of phylogenetic accuracy and resolution. SNP discovery and study of genome architecture and prophage content identified numerous biomarkers to assess the extent of genetic diversity within a set of clinical and environmental strains. A total of 1,225 SNPs were identified in the present study and are now available for typing of the E. coli O157:H7 lineage. These data should prove useful for the development of a refined phylogenomic framework for forensic, diagnostic, and epidemiological studies to define better risk in response to novel and emerging E. coli O157:H7 resistance and virulence phenotypes.},

The key virulence factors of ETEC strains, their serotypes, and their fimbrial components have been well studied. However, most studies to date have focused on plasmid-encoded traits related to colonization and toxin production, and the chromosomal backgrounds of these strains have been largely understudied. Here, we generated the genomic sequences of K88-positive and F18-positive porcine ETEC strains and examined the phylogenetic distribution of clinical porcine ETEC strains and their plasmid-associated genetic content. The genomes of porcine ETEC strains UMNK88 and UMNF18 were both found to contain remarkable plasmid complements containing known virulence factors, potential novel virulence factors, and antimicrobial resistance-associated elements. The chromosomes of these strains also possessed several unique genomic islands containing hypothetical genes with similarity to classical virulence factors, although phage-associated genomic islands dominated the accessory genomes of these strains. Phylogenetic analysis of 78 clinical isolates associated with neonatal and porcine diarrhea revealed that a limited subset of porcine ETEC lineages exist that generally contain common toxin and fimbrial profiles, with many of the isolates belonging to the ST10, ST23, and ST169 multilocus sequencing types. These lineages were generally distinct from existing human ETEC database isolates. Overall, most porcine ETEC strains appear to have emerged from a limited subset of E. coli lineages that either have an increased propensity to carry plasmid-encoded virulence factors or have the appropriate ETEC core genome required for virulence.},

The genus status and species classification appear no longer valid, as compelling evidence indicates that Shigella, as well as enteroinvasive Escherichia coli, are derived from multiple origins of E.coli and form a single pathovar. Nevertheless, Shigella dysenteriae serotype 1 causes deadly epidemics but Shigella boydii is restricted to the Indian subcontinent, while Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei are prevalent in developing and developed countries respectively. To begin to explain these distinctive epidemiological and pathological features at the genome level, we have carried out comparative genomics on four representative strains. Each of the Shigella genomes includes a virulence plasmid that encodes conserved primary virulence determinants. The Shigella chromosomes share most of their genes with that of E.coli K12 strain MG1655, but each has over 200 pseudogenes, 300 approximately 700 copies of insertion sequence (IS) elements, and numerous deletions, insertions, translocations and inversions. There is extensive diversity of putative virulence genes, mostly acquired via bacteriophage-mediated lateral gene transfer. Hence, via convergent evolution involving gain and loss of functions, through bacteriophage-mediated gene acquisition, IS-mediated DNA rearrangements and formation of pseudogenes, the Shigella spp. became highly specific human pathogens with variable epidemiological and pathological features.},

	abstract = {Genome comparisons have demonstrated that dramatic genetic change often underlies the emergence of new bacterial pathogens. Evolutionary analysis of Escherichia coli O157:H7, a pathogen that has emerged as a worldwide public health threat in the past two decades, has posited that this toxin-producing pathogen evolved in a series of steps from O55:H7, a recent ancestor of a nontoxigenic pathogenic clone associated with infantile diarrhea. We used comparative genomic hybridization with 50-mer oligonucleotide microarrays containing probes from both pathogenic and nonpathogenic genomes to infer when genes were acquired and lost. Many ancillary virulence genes identified in the O157 genome were already present in an O55:H7-like progenitor, with 27 of 33 genomic islands of {\textgreater}5 kb and specific for O157:H7 (O islands) that were acquired intact before the split from this immediate ancestor. Most (85\%) of variably absent or present genes are part of prophages or phage-like elements. Divergence in gene content among these closely related strains was approximately 140 times greater than divergence at the nucleotide sequence level. A {\textgreater}100-kb region around the O-antigen gene cluster contained highly divergent sequences and also appears to be duplicated in its entirety in one lineage, suggesting that the whole region was cotransferred in the antigenic shift from O55 to O157. The beta-glucuronidase-positive O157 variants, although phylogenetically closest to the Sakai strain, were divergent for multiple adherence factors. These observations suggest that, in addition to gains and losses of phage elements, O157:H7 genomes are rapidly diverging and radiating into new niches as the pathogen disseminates.},

However, strain CL3 (serotype O113:H21) contains only Z4321, not the other three genes. To determine whether Z4321 is part of a different genomic island in CL3, a region of 27,293 bp up- and downstream of Z4321 was sequenced and found to contain elements of two different EDL933 genomic islands (OI-48 and OI-122) and a Yersinia pestis-like hemolysin/adhesin gene cluster. The region contained OI-48 genes Z1635, Z1636, and Z1637 at the left terminus and Z1641, Z1642, Z1643, and Z1644 at the right. The middle portion consisted of OI-48 gene Z1640, which was separated into three fragments by genomic segments including the Y. pestis cluster and EDL933 OI-122 genes Z4322, Z4321, and Z4318.

In contrast, fragmented Z1640 was seen in strains of nonepidemic serotypes, such as O91:H21 and O113:H21, and in animal serotypes that have not been associated with human disease, indicating that Z1640 might be a virulence gene.},

Mascarenhas, S. Shen, K. Ziebell, S. Johnson, R. Reid-Smith, J. Isaac-Renton, C. Clark, K. Rahn, and J. B. Kaper, J. Clin. Microbiol. 41:4930-4940, 2003). The most prevalent adhesin was that encoded by the iha gene (91\%; 127 of 139 strains), which was distributed in all seropathotypes. toxB and efa1 were present mainly in strains of seropathotypes A and B, which were LEE positive. saa was present only in strains of seropathotypes C, D, and E, which were LEE negative. Two fimbrial genes, lpfA(O157/OI-141) and lpfA(O157/OI-154), were strongly associated with seropathotype A. The fimbrial gene lpfA(O113) was present in all seropathotypes except for seropathotype A, while sfpA was not present in any of the strains studied. The distribution of STEC adhesins depends mainly on serotypes and not on the source of isolation. Seropathotype A, which is associated with severe disease and frequently is involved in outbreaks, possesses a unique adhesin profile which is not present in the other seropathotypes. The wide distribution of iha in STEC strains suggested that it could be a candidate for vaccine development.},

Here we describe an additional, but LEE-negative genomic island in RW1374 in the vicinity of another phenylalanine tRNA gene, pheU, the sequence of which is identical to pheV. These two genomic islands revealed identity of the left, but a relative variability of their right end sequences. To investigate the mechanism of LEE-PAI distribution in E. coli, we analysed similar junctions in the pheU/pheV loci of additional EPEC and EHEC strains the LEE location of which had not been determined before. By hybridisation of NotI restriction fragments with probes specific for LEE, pheV locus, and pheU locus, the LEE was found linked to either one of these two loci. The results agreed well with recently published phylogenetic data and indicate that in the clones of diarrheagenic E. coli (Dec) Dec 11 and Dec 12, forming the phylogenetic cluster EPEC 2, and in the strains of the most typical serotypes of the Dec 8, belonging to the phylogenetic cluster EHEC 2, the LEE was linked with pheV and not with the pheU locus as previously assumed. Sequence comparison with other pheU- and pheV-located genomic islands from different E. coli pathotypes (uropathogenic E. coli, septicemic E. coli) as well as from Shigella indicated the same structural features at the junctions. These conserved structures suggested a common DNA cassette, serving as common vehicle for horizontal gene transfer of various PAls. In addition, the elements suggest an origin from a common pheU-located ancestor and integration into the chromosome through site-specific recombination. Our results indicate that pheU/pheV-located genomic islands played an important role in the evolution of several PAls in E. coli and related pathogens.},

	abstract = {There are 29 E. coli genome sequences available, mostly related to studies of species diversity or mode of pathogenicity, including two genomes of the well-known O157:H7 clone. However, there have been no genome studies of closely related clones aimed at exposing the details of evolutionary change. Here we sequenced the genome of an O55:H7 strain, closely related to the major pathogenic O157:H7 clone, with published genome sequences, and undertook comparative genomic and proteomic analysis. We were able to allocate most differences between the genomes to individual mutations, recombination events, or lateral gene transfer events, in specific lineages. Major differences include a type II secretion system present only in the O55:H7 chromosome, fewer type III secretion system effectors in O55:H7, and 19 phage genomes or phagelike elements in O55:H7 compared to 23 in O157:H7, with only three common to both. Many other changes were found in both O55:H7 and O157:H7 lineages, but in general there has been more change in the O157:H7 lineages. For example, we found 50\% more synonymous mutational substitutions in O157:H7 compared to O55:H7. The two strains also diverged at the proteomic level. Mutational synonymous SNPs were used to estimate a divergence time of 400 years using a new clock rate, in contrast to 14,000 to 70,000 years using the traditional clock rates. The same approaches were applied to three closely related extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli genomes, and similar levels of mutation and recombination were found. This study revealed for the first time the full range of events involved in the evolution of the O157:H7 clone from its O55:H7 ancestor, and suggested that O157:H7 arose quite recently. Our findings also suggest that E. coli has a much lower frequency of recombination relative to mutation than was observed in a comparable study of a Vibrio cholerae lineage.},

Sixty-one publically available E. coli and Shigella spp. sequenced genomes are compared, using basic methods to produce phylogenetic and proteomics trees, and to identify the pan- and core genomes of this set of sequenced strains. A hierarchical clustering of variable genes allowed clear separation of the strains into clusters, including known pathotypes; clinically relevant serotypes can also be resolved in this way. In contrast, when in silico MLST was performed, many of the various strains appear jumbled and less well resolved. The predicted pan-genome comprises 15,741 gene families, and only 993 (6\%) of the families are represented in every genome, comprising the core genome. The variable or 'accessory' genes thus make up more than 90\% of the pan-genome and about 80\% of a typical genome; some of these variable genes tend to be co-localized on genomic islands. The diversity within the species E. coli, and the overlap in gene content between this and related species, suggests a continuum rather than sharp species borders in this group of Enterobacteriaceae.},

Although serotype O157:H7 strains are the most prevalent, strains of different serotypes also possess similar pathogenic potential. Here, we present the results of a genomic comparison between EHECs of serotype O157, O26, O111, and O103, as well as 21 other, fully sequenced E. coli/Shigella strains. All EHECs have much larger genomes (5.5-5.9 Mb) than the other strains and contain surprisingly large numbers of prophages and integrative elements (IEs). The gene contents of the 4 EHECs do not follow the phylogenetic relationships of the strains, and they share virulence genes for Shiga toxins and many other factors. We found many lambdoid phages, IEs, and virulence plasmids that carry the same or similar virulence genes but have distinct evolutionary histories, indicating that independent acquisition of these mobile genetic elements has driven the evolution of each EHEC. Particularly interesting is the evolution of the type III secretion system (T3SS). We found that the T3SS of EHECs is composed of genes that were introduced by 3 different types of genetic elements: an IE referred to as the locus of enterocyte effacement, which encodes a central part of the T3SS; SpLE3-like IEs; and lambdoid phages carrying numerous T3SS effector genes and other T3SS-related genes. Our data demonstrate how E. coli strains of different phylogenies can independently evolve into EHECs, providing unique insights into the mechanisms underlying the parallel evolution of complex virulence systems in bacteria.},

	abstract = {The capacity of Shiga toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC) to adhere to the intestinal mucosa undoubtedly contributes to pathogenesis of human disease. The majority of STEC strains isolated from severe cases produce attaching and effacing lesions on the intestinal mucosa, a property mediated by the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island. This element is not essential for pathogenesis, as some cases of severe disease, including hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), are caused by LEE-negative STEC strains, but the mechanism whereby these adhere to the intestinal mucosa is not understood. We have isolated a gene from the megaplasmid of a LEE-negative O113:H21 STEC strain (98NK2) responsible for an outbreak of HUS, which encodes an auto-agglutinating adhesin designated Saa (STEC autoagglutinating adhesin). Introduction of saa cloned in pBC results in a 9.7-fold increase in adherence of E. coli JM109 to HEp-2 cells and a semilocalized adherence pattern. Mutagenesis of saa in 98NK2, or curing the wild-type strain of its megaplasmid, resulted in a significant reduction in adherence. Homologues of saa were found in several unrelated LEE-negative STEC serotypes, including O48:H21 (strain 94CR) and O91:H21 (strain B2F1), which were also isolated from patients with HUS. Saa exhibits a low degree of similarity (25\% amino acid [aa] identity) with YadA of Yersinia enterocolitica and Eib, a recently described phage-encoded immunoglobulin binding protein from E. coli. Saa produced by 98NK2 is 516 aa long and includes four copies of a 37-aa direct repeat sequence. Interestingly, Saa produced by other STEC strains ranges in size from 460 to 534 aa as a consequence of variation in the number of repeats and/or other insertions or deletions immediately proximal to the repeat domain.},

Seropathotype A comprised 10 serotype O157:H7 and 3 serotype O157:NM strains. Seropathotype B (associated with outbreaks and HUS but less commonly than serotype O157:H7) comprised three strains each of serotypes O26:H11, O103:H2, O111:NM, O121:H19, and O145:NM. Seropathotype C comprised four strains each of serotypes O91:H21 and O113:H21 and eight strains of other serotypes that have been associated with sporadic HUS but not typically with outbreaks. Seropathotype D comprised 14 strains of serotypes that have been associated with diarrhea but not with outbreaks or HUS, and seropathotype E comprised animal VTEC strains of serotypes not implicated in human disease. All strains were tested for four EDL 933 OI-122 virulence genes (Z4321, Z4326, Z4332, and Z4333) by PCR. Negative PCRs were confirmed by Southern hybridization. Overall, 28 (40\%) strains contained OI-122 (positive for all four virulence genes), 27 (38.6\%) contained an "incomplete" OI-122 (positive for one to three genes), and 15 (21.4\%) strains did not contain OI-122.

Non-O157 STEC, particularly O26, O45, O103, O111, O121, and O145, have also been recognized as a major public health concern. Unlike O157, detection procedures for non-O157 have not been fully developed. Our objective was to develop a multiplex PCR to distinguish O157 and the 'top six' non-O157 serogroups (O26, O45, O103, O111, O121, and O145) and evaluate the applicability of the multiplex PCR to detect the seven serogroups of E. coli in cattle feces. Published sequences of O-specific antigen coding genes, rfbE (O157) and wzx and wbqE-F (non-O157), were analyzed to design serogroup-specific primers. The specificity of amplifications was confirmed with 138 known STEC strains and the reaction yielded the expected amplicons for each serogroup. In feces spiked with pooled 7 STEC strains, the sensitivity of the detection was 4.1 × 10(5)CFU/g before enrichment and 2.3 × 10(2) after 6h enrichment in E. coli broth. Additionally, 216 fecal samples from cattle were collected and tested by multiplex PCR and cultural methods. The multiplex PCR revealed a high prevalence of all seven serogroups (178 [O26], 108 [O45], 149 [O103], 30 [O111], 103 [O121], 5 [O145], and 160 [O157]) of 216 samples in fecal samples. Cultural procedures identified 33.1\% (53/160) and 35.5\% (11/31) of PCR-positive samples for E. coli O157 and non-O157 serogroups, respectively. Samples that were culture-positive were all positive by the multiplex PCR. The multiplex PCR can be used to identify serogroups of putative STEC isolates.},

Differences in HUS frequency among E. coli O157:H7 outbreaks have been noted, but our understanding of bacterial factors that promote HUS is incomplete. In 2006, in an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 caused by consumption of contaminated spinach, there was a notably high frequency of HUS. We sequenced the genome of the strain responsible (TW14359) with the goal of identifying candidate genetic factors that contribute to an enhanced ability to cause HUS. The TW14359 genome contains 70 kb of DNA segments not present in either of the two reference O157:H7 genomes. We identified seven putative virulence determinants, including two putative type III secretion system effector proteins, candidate genes that could result in increased pathogenicity or, alternatively, adaptation to plants, and an intact anaerobic nitric oxide reductase gene, norV. We surveyed 100 O157:H7 isolates for the presence of these putative virulence determinants. A norV deletion was found in over one-half of the strains surveyed and correlated strikingly with the absence of stx(1). The other putative virulence factors were found in 8 to 35\% of the O157:H7 isolates surveyed, and their presence also correlated with the presence of norV and the absence of stx(1), indicating that the presence of norV may serve as a marker of a greater propensity for HUS, similar to the correlation between the absence of stx(1) and a propensity for HUS.},

Whole genome sequencing of an outbreak isolate, Xuzhou21, showed that the isolate is phylogenetically closely related to the Japan 1996 outbreak isolate Sakai, both of which share the most recent common ancestor with the US outbreak isolate EDL933. The levels of IL-6 and IL-8 of peripheral blood mononuclear cells induced by Xuzhou21 and Sakai were significantly higher than that induced by EDL933. Xuzhou21 also induced a significantly higher level of IL-8 than Sakai while both induced similar levels of IL-6. The expression level of Shiga toxin 2 in Xuzhou21 induced by mitomycin C was 68.6 times of that under non-inducing conditions, twice of that induced in Sakai (32.7 times) and 15 times higher than that induced in EDL933 (4.5 times).

	abstract = {The Shiga toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC) O113:H21 strain 98NK2, which was responsible for an outbreak of hemolytic uremic syndrome, secretes a highly potent and lethal subtilase cytotoxin that is unrelated to any bacterial toxin described to date. It is the prototype of a new family of AB(5) toxins, comprising a single 35-kilodalton (kD) A subunit and a pentamer of 13-kD B subunits. The A subunit is a subtilase-like serine protease distantly related to the BA\_2875 gene product of Bacillus anthracis. The B subunit is related to a putative exported protein from Yersinia pestis, and binds to a mimic of the ganglioside GM2. Subtilase cytotoxin is encoded by two closely linked, cotranscribed genes (subA and subB), which, in strain 98NK2, are located on a large, conjugative virulence plasmid. Homologues of the genes are present in 32 out of 68 other STEC strains tested. Intraperitoneal injection of purified subtilase cytotoxin was fatal for mice and resulted in extensive microvascular thrombosis, as well as necrosis in the brain, kidneys, and liver. Oral challenge of mice with E. coli K-12-expressing cloned subA and subB resulted in dramatic weight loss. These findings suggest that the toxin may contribute to the pathogenesis of human disease.},

A three-way genome comparison of the CFT073, enterohemorrhagic E. coli EDL933, and laboratory strain MG1655 reveals that, amazingly, only 39.2\% of their combined (nonredundant) set of proteins actually are common to all three strains. The pathogen genomes are as different from each other as each pathogen is from the benign strain. The difference in disease potential between O157:H7 and CFT073 is reflected in the absence of genes for type III secretion system or phage- and plasmid-encoded toxins found in some classes of diarrheagenic E. coli. The CFT073 genome is particularly rich in genes that encode potential fimbrial adhesins, autotransporters, iron-sequestration systems, and phase-switch recombinases. Striking differences exist between the large pathogenicity islands of CFT073 and two other well-studied uropathogenic E. coli strains, J96 and 536. Comparisons indicate that extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli arose independently from multiple clonal lineages. The different E. coli pathotypes have maintained a remarkable synteny of common, vertically evolved genes, whereas many islands interrupting this common backbone have been acquired by different horizontal transfer events in each strain.},

	abstract = {Escherichia coli strains causing urinary tract infection (UTI) are increasingly recognized as belonging to specific clones. E. coli clone O25b:H4-ST131 has recently emerged globally as a leading multi-drug resistant pathogen causing urinary tract and bloodstream infections in hospitals and the community. While most molecular studies to date examine the mechanisms conferring multi-drug resistance in E. coli ST131, relatively little is known about their virulence potential. Here we examined E. coli ST131 clinical isolates from two geographically diverse collections, one representing the major pathogenic lineages causing UTI across the United Kingdom and a second representing UTI isolates from patients presenting at two large hospitals in Australia. We determined a draft genome sequence for one representative isolate, E. coli EC958, which produced CTX-M-15 extended-spectrum β-lactamase, CMY-23 type AmpC cephalosporinase and was resistant to ciprofloxacin. Comparative genome analysis indicated that EC958 encodes virulence genes commonly associated with uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC). The genome sequence of EC958 revealed a transposon insertion in the fimB gene encoding the activator of type 1 fimbriae, an important UPEC bladder colonization factor. We identified the same fimB transposon insertion in 59\% of the ST131 UK isolates, as well as 71\% of ST131 isolates from Australia, suggesting this mutation is common among E. coli ST131 strains. Insertional inactivation of fimB resulted in a phenotype resembling a slower off-to-on switching for type 1 fimbriae. Type 1 fimbriae expression could still be induced in fimB-null isolates; this correlated strongly with adherence to and invasion of human bladder cells and bladder colonisation in a mouse UTI model. We conclude that E. coli ST131 is a geographically widespread, antibiotic resistant clone that has the capacity to produce numerous virulence factors associated with UTI.},

	abstract = {Shiga toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC) harbouring the stx(2d-activatable) gene and expressing the mucus- and elastase-activatable phenotype have been associated with severe outcomes of human disease. However, there is limited data available on the occurrence of such strains in livestock reservoirs. In this study, we analyzed 11 STEC strains isolated from healthy cattle and sheep at slaughter that were originally detected to contain the stx(2c) allele, for the presence of the stx(2d-activatable) genotype. Ten of the eleven strains displayed the stx(2d-activatable) genotype as determine by PstI restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of 890-bp fragments of their stx genes. However, only in 6 of the 10 strains whose stx genes were sequenced, the presence of stx(2d-activatable) could be confirmed based on the predicted amino acid sequence of their StxA subunits; the remaining four strains contained Stx2c A subunit. Five of the six strains which contained stx(2d-activatable) displayed the activatable phenotype on Vero cells. Genes for adhesins such as the outer membrane protein intimin (eae), which is essential for the intimate attachment and the formation of attaching-and-effacing lesions on intestinal epithelial cells, or the STEC autoagglutinating adhesin (saa), potentially important in eae-negative STEC, were not detected. Moreover, all the strains tested negative for EHEC-hlyA encoding enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) hemolysin. To our knowledge, this is the first study that reports the presence of STEC harbouring stx(2d-activatable) and producing the activatable Stx2d in fecal samples of sheep. Therefore both cattle and sheep are reservoirs of such strains and potential sources of human infections. This is of particular importance, because in contrast to other eae-negative STEC, strains producing Stx2d(activatable) may cause severe diseases such as bloody diarrhoea and haemolytic uremic syndrome in humans.},

Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) that do not encode the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE-negative STEC) often possess Shiga toxin gene variants and have been isolated from humans and a variety of animal sources. In this study, we compare the genomes of nine LEE-negative STEC harboring various stx alleles with four complete reference LEE-positive STEC isolates. Compared to a representative collection of prototype E. coli and Shigella isolates representing each of the pathotypes, the whole genome phylogeny demonstrated that these isolates are diverse. Whole genome comparative analysis of the 13 genomes revealed that in addition to the absence of the LEE pathogenicity island, phage-encoded genes including non-LEE encoded effectors, were absent from all nine LEE-negative STEC genomes. Several plasmid-encoded virulence factors reportedly identified in LEE-negative STEC isolates were identified in only a subset of the nine LEE-negative isolates further confirming the diversity of this group. In combination with whole genome analysis, we characterized the lambdoid phages harboring the various stx alleles and determined their genomic insertion sites. Although the integrase gene sequence corresponded with genomic location, it was not correlated with stx variant, further highlighting the mosaic nature of these phages. The transcription of these phages in different genomic backgrounds was examined. Expression of the Shiga toxin genes, stx(1) and/or stx(2), as well as the Q genes, were examined with quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays. A wide range of basal and induced toxin induction was observed. Overall, this is a first significant foray into the genome space of this unexplored group of emerging and divergent pathogens.},

Subsequently, numerous STEC strains have been characterized that express toxins with variations in amino acid sequence, some of which confer unique biological properties. These variants were grouped within the Stx1 or Stx2 type and often assigned names to indicate that they were not identical in sequence or phenotype to the main Stx1 or Stx2 type. A lack of specificity or consistency in toxin nomenclature has led to much confusion in the characterization of STEC strains. Because serious outcomes of infection have been attributed to certain Stx subtypes and less so with others, we sought to better define the toxin subtypes within the main Stx1 and Stx2 types. We compared the levels of relatedness of 285 valid sequence variants of Stx1 and Stx2 and identified common sequences characteristic of each of three Stx/Stx1 and seven Stx2 subtypes. A novel, simple PCR subtyping method was developed, independently tested on a battery of 48 prototypic STEC strains, and improved at six clinical and research centers to test the reproducibility, sensitivity, and specificity of the PCR. Using a consistent schema for nomenclature of the Stx toxins and stx genes by phylogenetic sequence-based relatedness of the holotoxin proteins, we developed a typing approach that should obviate the need to bioassay each newly described toxin and that predicts important biological characteristics.},

Consequently, economic studies based on the previous estimates are now obsolete. This study was conducted to provide improved and updated estimates of the cost of foodborne illness by adding a replication of the 2011 CDC model to existing cost-of-illness models. The basic cost-of-illness model  includes economic estimates for medical costs, productivity losses, and illness-related mortality (based on hedonic value-of-statistical-life studies). The enhanced cost-of-illness model replaces the productivity loss estimates with a more inclusive pain, suffering, and functional disability  measure based on monetized quality-adjusted life year estimates. Costs are estimated for each pathogen and a broader class of unknown pathogens. The addition of updated cost data and improvements to methodology enhanced the performance of each existing economic model. Uncertainty in these  models was characterized using Monte Carlo simulations in @Risk version 5.5. With this model, the average cost per case of foodborne illness was \$1,626 (90\% credible interval [CI], \$607 to \$3,073) for the enhanced cost-of-illness model and \$1,068 (90\% CI, \$683  to \$1,646) for the basic model.

Colonization factor antigen (CFA) I and II pili, and type 1 somatic pili, promote adhesion of human ETEC pathogens to epithelial cells in vitro and are generally recognized as accessory virulence factors. CFA/I and II were found in only 25\% of 36 human ETEC infections; positive strains were usually LT+/ST+ (LT: heat-labile; ST: heat-stable). Strains lacking CFA/I and II are virulent; other factors must be responsible for adhesion in such strains. While none of 14 LT+/ST- strains elaborated CFA/I or II, 10 (71\%) possessed type 1 somatic pili. An initial ETEC diarrhoeal infection in volunteers stimulated protective immunity against diarrhoea on re-challenge with the same strain. Despite clinical protection healthy "veterans" excreted the ETEC strain to the same degree as ill controls. Thus the mechanisms of immunity was not bactericidal. Disease-induced LT antitoxic immunity failed to protect volunteers against challenge with a heterologous (LT+/ST-) strain. One explanation of these observations is that the mechanism of protection was anti-adhesive with antibody directed against adhesive factors on the bacterial surface preventing attachment of bacteria to receptors on small intestinal mucosal cells. Immunoprophylaxis against ETEC in humans with purified pili vaccines appears feasible.},

	abstract = {Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC) strains cause serious gastrointestinal disease, which can lead to potentially life-threatening systemic complications such as hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Although the production of Shiga toxin has been considered to be the main virulence trait of STEC for many years, the capacity to colonize the host intestinal epithelium is a crucial step in pathogenesis. In this study, we have characterized a novel megaplasmid-encoded outer membrane protein in locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE)-negative O113:H21 STEC strain 98NK2, termed Sab (for STEC autotransporter [AT] contributing to biofilm formation). The 4,296-bp sab gene encodes a 1,431-amino-acid protein with the features of members of the AT protein family. When expressed in E. coli JM109, Sab contributed to the diffuse adherence to human epithelial (HEp-2) cells and promoted biofilm formation on polystyrene surfaces. A 98NK2 sab deletion mutant was also defective in biofilm formation relative to its otherwise isogenic wild-type parent, and this was complemented by transformation with a sab-carrying plasmid. Interestingly, an unrelated O113:H21 STEC isolate that had a naturally occurring deletion in sab was similarly defective in biofilm formation. PCR analysis indicated that sab is present in LEE-negative STEC strains belonging to serotypes/groups O113:H21, O23, and O82:H8. These findings raise the possibility that Sab may contribute to colonization in a subset of LEE-negative STEC strains.},

The diseases caused by non-O157 STEC are generally milder than those induced by O157 STEC; nonetheless, non-O157 STEC strains have also been associated with serious illnesses such as hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome, as well as death. Ruminants, particularly cattle, are reservoirs for both O157 and non-O157 STEC, which are transmitted to humans by person-to-person or animal contact and by ingestion of food or water contaminated with animal feces. Improved strategies to control STEC colonization and shedding in cattle and contamination of meat and produce are needed. In general, non-O157 STEC respond to stresses such as acid, heat, and other stresses induced during food preparation similar to O157 STEC. Similar to O157:H7, the top six non-O157 STEC are classified as adulterants in beef by the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service, and regulatory testing for these pathogens began in June 2012. Due to the genetic and phenotypic variability of non-O157 STEC strains, the development of accurate and reliable methods for detection and isolation of these pathogens has been challenging. Since the non-O157 STEC are responsible for a large portion of STEC-related illnesses, more extensive studies on their physiology, genetics, pathogenicity, and evolution are needed in order to develop more effective control strategies.},

STEC strains were recovered from 53\% of roe deer, 8.4\% of wild boars, and 1.9\% of foxes sampled in the northwest of Spain (Galicia). Of the 40 serotypes identified, 21 were classified as seropathotypes associated with human disease, accounting for 81.5\% of the wildlife-carried STEC strains, including the enterohemorrhagic serotypes O157:H7-D-eae-γ1, O26:[H11]-B1-eae-β1, O121:H19-B1-eae-ε1, and O145:[H28]-D-eae-γ1. None of the wildlife-carried strains belonged to the highly pathogenic serotype O104:H4-B1 from the recent Germany outbreak. Forty percent of wildlife-carried STEC strains shared serotypes, phylogroups, intimin types, and Stx profiles with isolates from human patients from the same geographic area. Furthermore, wildlife-carried strains belonging to serotypes O5:HNM-A, O26:[H11]-B1, O76:H19-B1, O145:[H28]-D, O146:H21-B1, and O157:H7-D showed pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profiles with {\textgreater}85\% similarity to human-pathogenic STEC strains. We also found a high level of similarity among STEC strains of serotypes O5:HNM-A, O26:[H11]-B1, and O145:HNM-D of bovine (feces and beef) and wildlife origins. Interestingly, O146:H21-B1, the second most frequently detected serotype in this study, is commonly associated with human diarrhea and isolated from beef and vegetables sold in Galicia. Importantly, at least 3 STEC isolates from foxes (O5:HNM-A-eae-β1, O98:[H21]-B1-eae-ζ1, and O146:[H21]-B1) showed characteristics similar to those of human STEC strains.

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.
RESULTS: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is approximately 10-20x faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package.

Our objective was to estimate the global annual number of illnesses due to pathogenic STEC, and resultant hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and death.Materials: We searched Medline, Scopus, SIGLE/OpenGrey, and CABI and World Health Organization (WHO) databases for studies of STEC incidence in the general population, published between January 1, 1990 and April 30, 2012, in all languages. We searched health institution websites for notifiable disease data and reports, cross-referenced citations, and consulted international knowledge experts. We employed an a priori hierarchical study selection process and synthesized results using a stochastic simulation model to account for uncertainty inherent in the data.Results: We identified 16 articles and databases from 21 countries, from 10 of the 14 WHO Sub-Regions. We estimated that STEC causes 2,801,000 acute illnesses annually (95\% Credible Interval [Cr.I.]: 1,710,000; 5,227,000), and leads to 3890 cases of HUS (95\% Cr.I.: 2400; 6700), 270 cases of ESRD (95\% Cr.I.: 20; 800), and 230 deaths (95\% Cr.I.: 130; 420). Sensitivity analyses indicated these estimates are likely conservative.Conclusions: These are the first estimates of the global incidence of STEC-related illnesses, which have not been explicitly included in previous global burden of disease estimations. Compared to other pathogens with a foodborne transmission component, STEC appears to cause more cases than alveolar echinococcosis each year, but less than typhoid fever, foodborne trematodes, and nontyphoidal salmonellosis.Applications: Given the persistence of STEC globally, efforts aimed at reducing the burden of foodborne disease should consider the relative contribution of STEC in the target population.},

To repel infection by phage and mobile genetic elements, prokaryotes have a form of adaptive immune response and memory invested in clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and associated proteins (CRISPR-Cas). This molecular machinery can recognize and remember foreign nucleic acids by capturing and retaining small nucleotide sequences. On subsequent encounters, the cognate CRISPR-Cas marshals enzymatic defenses to destroy infecting elements that contain the same sequences. Jackson et al. review the molecular mechanisms by which diverse CRISPR-Cas systems adapt and anticipate novel threats and evasive countermeasures from mobile genetic elements.

BACKGROUNDThe arms race between prokaryotes and their perpetually evolving predators has fueled the evolution of a defense arsenal. The so-called CRISPR-Cas systems—clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and associated proteins—are adaptive immune defense systems found in bacteria and archaea. The recent exponential growth of research in the CRISPR field has led to the discovery of a diverse range of CRISPR-Cas systems and insight into their defense functions. These systems are divided into two major classes and six types. Each system consists of two components: a locus for memory storage (the CRISPR array) and cas genes that encode the machinery driving immunity. Information stored within CRISPR arrays is used to direct the sequence-specific destruction of invading genetic elements, including viruses and plasmids. As such, all CRISPR-Cas immune systems are reliant on the formation of CRISPR memories, known as spacers, to facilitate future defense. To form these memories, small fragments of invader nucleic acids are added as spacers to the CRISPR memory banks in a process termed CRISPR adaptation. The genetic basis of immunity means that CRISPR adaptation provides heritable benefits, an attribute that is unparalleled in eukaryotic immune systems. There is widespread evidence of highly active CRISPR adaptation in nature, and it is clear that these systems play important roles in shaping microbial evolution and global ecological networks.
ADVANCESCRISPR adaptation requires several processes, including selection and processing of spacer precursors and their subsequent localization to, and integration into, the CRISPR loci. Although our understanding of all facets of the CRISPR adaptation pathway is not yet complete, considerable progress has been made in the past few years. At the heart of CRISPR adaptation is a protein complex, the Cas1-Cas2 “workhorse,” which catalyzes the addition of new spacers to CRISPR memory banks. A combination of functional assays and high-resolution structures of Cas1-Cas2 complexes has recently led to major advances. There is now a sound understanding of how foreign DNA is converted to prespacer substrates and captured by the Cas1-Cas2 complex. After this, Cas1-Cas2 locates the genomic CRISPR locus and docks in the appropriate position for insertion of the new spacer into the CRISPR array, while duplicating a CRISPR repeat. The cues directing the docking of substrate-laden Cas1-Cas2 differ between systems, with some relying on intrinsic sequence specificity and others assisted by host proteins. Before integration, accurate processing of the spacer precursors is required to ensure that the new spacers are compatible with the protein machinery in order to elicit CRISPR-Cas defense. For a given CRISPR-Cas system, spacers must typically be of a certain length and be inserted into the CRISPR in a specific orientation. It is becoming increasingly apparent that Cas1-Cas2 complexes from diverse systems are capable of ensuring that these system-specific factors are met with high fidelity.New findings also account for the ordering of stored memories: Typically, the insertion of new spacers is directed to one end of CRISPR arrays, and it has been shown that this enhances immunity against recently encountered invaders. The chronological ordering of new spacers has enabled insights into the temporal dynamics of interactions between hosts and invaders that are constantly changing. Some CRISPR-Cas systems use existing spacers to recognize previously encountered elements and promote the formation of new CRISPR memories, a process known as primed CRISPR adaptation. Viruses and plasmids that have escaped previous CRISPR-Cas defenses through genetic mutations trigger primed CRISPR adaptation. Several recent studies have revealed that primed CRISPR adaptation is also strongly promoted by recurrent invaders, even in the absence of escape mutations. This has led to previously separate paradigms of invader destruction and primed CRISPR adaptation beginning to converge into a unified model.
OUTLOOKCRISPR adaptation is crucial for ensuring both population-level protection through spacer diversity and protection of the host through invader clearance. Although many studies have explored CRISPR adaptation in a broad range of host-specific and metagenomic contexts, much of the mechanistic detail has been gleaned from studying a relatively small subset of systems. Thus, despite the relative wealth of mechanistic information about CRISPR adaptation in a few specific types, work in other systems continues to reveal distinct modes of operation for spacer acquisition. Therefore, studies of CRISPR adaptation in alternative systems are necessary to determine which processes are conserved and which are system-specific. An important remaining question is why the enhanced primed CRISPR adaptation commonly found in type I systems has not yet been observed in other types. Do other systems possess analogous mechanisms that have yet to be discovered, or does the absence of priming in these systems explain the prevalence of type I systems in nature? Future expansion of our understanding of how CRISPR adaptation is carried out in the diverse repertoire of CRISPR-Cas systems is vital for maximizing the potential for repurposing the spacer acquisition machinery in biotechnological applications. Commandeering CRISPR adaptation for on-demand memory formation will usher in a new era of biological information storage, with many applications that await discovery. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/356/6333/eaal5056/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Many hues of the CRISPR-Cas adaptation machinery.The complex of the Cas1 and Cas2 proteins, which is the workhorse of CRISPR adaptation in diverse CRISPR-Cas prokaryotic immune systems, is depicted with a DNA substrate. Despite the near-ubiquitous Cas1-Cas2 molecular machinery, type-specific differences in the insertion of new information into CRISPR memory banks are beginning to come to light.
Bacteria and archaea are engaged in a constant arms race to defend against the ever-present threats of viruses and invasion by mobile genetic elements. The most flexible weapons in the prokaryotic defense arsenal are the CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems. These systems are capable of selective identification and neutralization of foreign DNA and/or RNA. CRISPR-Cas systems rely on stored genetic memories to facilitate target recognition. Thus, to keep pace with a changing pool of hostile invaders, the CRISPR memory banks must be regularly updated with new information through a process termed CRISPR adaptation. In this Review, we outline the recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing CRISPR adaptation. Specifically, the conserved protein machinery Cas1-Cas2 is the cornerstone of adaptive immunity in a range of diverse CRISPR-Cas systems.},

The type VI secretion system (T6SS) has been shown to be involved in the bacterial pathogenicity and bacteria-bacteria competition. Here, we show that EHEC could secrete a novel effector KatN, a Mn-containing catalase, in a T6SS-dependent manner. Expression of katN is promoted by RpoS and OxyR and repressed by H-NS, and katN contributes to bacterial growth under oxidative stress in vitro. KatN could be secreted into host cell cytosol after EHEC is phagocytized by macrophage, which leads to decreased level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and facilitates the intramacrophage survival of EHEC. Finally, animal model results show that the deletion mutant of T6SS was attenuated in virulence compared with the wild type strain, while the deletion mutant of katN had comparable virulence to the wild type strain. Taken together, our findings suggest that EHEC could sense oxidative stress in phagosome and decrease the host cell ROS by secreting catalase KatN to facilitate its survival in the host cells.},

	abstract = {Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) is defined by aggregative adherence (AA) to HEp-2 cells, where bacteria display adherence to cell surfaces and also to the intervening substratum in a stacked-brick configuration. We previously showed that an AraC homologue designated AggR is required for the expression of plasmid-encoded genes that mediate AA of EAEC strain 042. In this study, we hypothesized that AggR also controls the expression of other virulence determinants in EAEC 042. Using proteomic and microarray analysis, we identified for the first time that AggR activates the expression of chromosomal genes, including 25 contiguous genes (aaiA–Y), which are localized to a 117 kb pathogenicity island (PAI) inserted at pheU. Many of these genes have homologues in other Gram-negative bacteria and were recently proposed to constitute a type VI secretion system (T6SS). AaiC was identified as a secreted protein that has no apparent homologues within GenBank. EAEC strains carrying in-frame deletions of aaiB, aaiG, aaiO or aaiP still synthesized AaiC; however, AaiC secretion was abolished. Cloning of aai genes into E. coli HB101 suggested that aaiA–P are sufficient for AaiC secretion. A second T6SS was identified within the pheU PAI that secretes a protein unrelated by sequence identity to AaiC. Distribution studies indicated that aaiA and aaiC are commonly found in EAEC isolates worldwide, particularly in strains defined as typical EAEC. These data support the hypothesis that AggR is a global regulator of EAEC virulence determinants, and builds on the hypothesis that T6SS is an importance mediator of pathogenesis.},

ETT2sepsis has several premature stop codons and a large (5 kb) deletion, which is conserved in 11 E. coli strains from cases of septicemia and newborn meningitis.

	abstract = {Type III secretion systems (T3SSs) are crucial for bacterial infections because they deliver effector proteins into host cells. The Escherichia coli type III secretion system 2 (ETT2) is present in the majority of E. coli strains, and although it is degenerate, ETT2 regulates bacterial virulence. An ATPase is essential for T3SS secretion, but the function of the ETT2 ATPase has not been demonstrated. Here we show that EivC is homologous to the β subunit of F0F1 ATPases and it possesses ATPase activity. To investigate the effects of ETT2 ATPase EivC on the phenotype and virulence of avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC), eivC mutant and complemented strains were constructed and characterized. Inactivation of eivC led to impaired flagella production and augmented fimbriae on the bacterial surface, and, consequently, reduced bacterial motility. In addition, the eivC mutant strain exhibited attenuated virulence in ducks, diminished serum resistance, reduced survival in macrophage cells and in ducks, upregulated fimbrial gene expression, and downregulated flagellar and virulence gene expression. The expression of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-8 were increased in HD-11 macrophages infected with the eivC mutant strain, compared with the wild-type strain. These virulence-related phenotypes were restored by genetic complementation. These findings demonstrate that ETT2 ATPase EivC is involved in the motility and pathogenicity of APEC.},

	abstract = {Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) is increasingly recognized as a diarrhoeal pathogen in developing and industrialized countries. Most EAEC virulence factors thus far described are encoded on virulence plasmid pAA, yet recent completion of the EAEC genome has suggested the presence of additional factors encoded on chromosomal islands. Previous reports have recognized the presence of a type III secretion system (T3SS), designated ETT2, at the glyU locus of prototype EAEC strain 042, along with possible T3SS effectors at the selC locus. The selC locus was also noted to harbour homologues of Salmonella enterica regulator HilA and of invasin from Yersinia spp., yet previous publications suggested that these loci may be silent. Here, we show that the genes of the selC locus are present inconsistently among a collection of well-characterized EAEC strains. Notably, however, there was perfect correlation between the presence of hilA-homologue eilA and predicted Yersinia invasin homologue gene eaeX. We hypothesized that if expressed, the putative gene product EilA would contribute to EAEC virulence in part by activation of the T3SS and its effectors. An eilA mutant was constructed in EAEC strain 042, and complementation was achieved by cloning the eilA gene under control of an arabinose-dependent promoter. In this system, we observed expression of at least seven genes to be affected by expression of eilA, either directly or indirectly: selC locus genes eipB, eipC, eipD, eicA and eaeX (renamed here air), as well as glyU ETT2 genes eivF and eivA. Notably, the eilA mutant was shown to be less adherent to epithelial cells in culture and to form less abundant biofilms than the isogenic parent. These effects were recapitulated in the air mutant, suggesting that the predicted outer membrane protein product of the air gene is involved as an accessory adhesin and aggregin of EAEC, coexpressed with the T3SS. Our data suggest that the T3SS of EAEC and presumed effectors located on different chromosomal islands may be coordinately activated by EilA, which also activates the genetically linked high molecular weight bacterial surface protein Air. Contributions of this new putative virulence-related regulon in EAEC may include adherence, aggregation, and as yet uncharacterized roles for the T3SS.},

	abstract = {ETT2 is a second cryptic type III secretion system in Escherichia coli which was first discovered through the analysis of genome sequences of enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7. Comparative analyses of Escherichia and Shigella genome sequences revealed that the ETT2 gene cluster is larger than was previously thought, encompassing homologues of genes from the Spi-1, Spi-2, and Spi-3 Salmonella pathogenicity islands. ETT2-associated genes, including regulators and chaperones, were found at the same chromosomal location in the majority of genome-sequenced strains, including the laboratory strain K-12. Using a PCR-based approach, we constructed a complete tiling path through the ETT2 gene cluster for 79 strains, including the well-characterized E. coli reference collection supplemented with additional pathotypes. The ETT2 gene cluster was found to be present in whole or in part in the majority of E. coli strains, whether pathogenic or commensal, with patterns of distribution and deletion mirroring the known phylogenetic structure of the species. In almost all strains, including enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7, ETT2 has been subjected to varying degrees of mutational attrition that render it unable to encode a functioning secretion system. A second type III secretion system-associated locus that likely encodes the ETT2 translocation apparatus was found in some E. coli strains. Intact versions of both ETT2-related clusters are apparently present in enteroaggregative E. coli strain O42.},

At least in some strains they provide an efficient barrier against transmissible genetic elements such as plasmids and viruses. Two CRISPR-Cas systems have been identified in Escherichia coli, pertaining to subtypes I-E (\textit{cas}-E genes) and I-F (\textit{cas}-F genes), respectively. In order to unveil the evolutionary dynamics of such systems, we analyzed the sequence variations in the CRISPR-Cas loci of a collection of 131 E. coli strains. Our results show that the strain grouping inferred from these CRISPR data slightly differs from the phylogeny of the species, suggesting the occurrence of recombinational events between CRISPR arrays. Moreover, we determined that the primary \textit{cas}-E genes of E. coli were altogether replaced with a substantially different variant in a minor group of strains that include K-12. Insertion elements play an important role in this variability. This result underlines the interchange capacity of CRISPR-Cas constituents and hints that at least some functional aspects documented for the K-12 system may not apply to the vast majority of E. coli strains.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}\textbf{IMPORTANCE}Escherichia coli is a model microorganism for the study of diverse aspects such as microbial evolution and is a component of the human gut flora that may have a direct impact in everyday life. This work was undertaken with the purpose of elucidating the evolutionary pathways that have led to the present situation of its significantly different CRISPR-Cas subtypes (I-E and I-F) in several strains of E. coli. In doing so, this information offers a novel and wider understanding of the variety and relevance of these regions within the species. Therefore, this knowledge may provide clues helping researchers better understand these systems for typing purposes and make predictions of their behavior in strains that, depending on their particular genetic dotation, would result in different levels of immunity to foreign genetic elements.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: No access to safe water is an important risk factor for typhoid fever, yet risk-level heterogeneity is unaccounted for in previous global burden estimates. Since WHO has recommended risk-based use of typhoid polysaccharide vaccine, we revisited the burden of typhoid fever in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) after adjusting for water-related risk.
METHODS: We estimated the typhoid disease burden from studies done in LMICs based on blood-culture-confirmed incidence rates applied to the 2010 population, after correcting for operational issues related to surveillance, limitations of diagnostic tests, and water-related risk. We derived incidence estimates, correction factors, and mortality estimates from systematic literature reviews. We did scenario analyses for risk factors, diagnostic sensitivity, and case fatality rates, accounting for the uncertainty in these estimates and we compared them with previous disease burden estimates.
FINDINGS: The estimated number of typhoid fever cases in LMICs in 2010 after adjusting for water-related risk was 11·9 million (95\% CI 9·9-14·7) cases with 129 000 (75 000-208 000) deaths. By comparison, the estimated risk-unadjusted burden was 20·6 million (17·5-24·2) cases and 223 000 (131 000-344 000) deaths. Scenario analyses indicated that the risk-factor adjustment and updated diagnostic test correction factor derived from systematic literature reviews were the drivers of differences between the current estimate and past estimates.
INTERPRETATION: The risk-adjusted typhoid fever burden estimate was more conservative than previous estimates. However, by distinguishing the risk differences, it will allow assessment of the effect at the population level and will facilitate cost-effectiveness calculations for risk-based vaccination strategies for future typhoid conjugate vaccine.},

	abstract = {Background
Typhoid and paratyphoid fever remain important causes of morbidity worldwide. Accurate disease burden estimates are needed to guide policy decisions and prevention and control strategies.

Methods
We conducted a systematic literature review of the PubMed and Scopus databases using pre-defined criteria to identify population-based studies with typhoid fever incidence data published between 1980 and 2009. We also abstracted data from annual reports of notifiable diseases in countries with advanced surveillance systems. Typhoid and paratyphoid fever input data were grouped into regions and regional incidence and mortality rates were estimated. Incidence data were extrapolated across regions for those lacking data. Age-specific incidence rates were derived for regions where age-specific data were available. Crude and adjusted estimates of the global typhoid fever burden were calculated.

Results
Twenty-five studies were identified, all of which contained incidence data on typhoid fever and 12 on paratyphoid fever. Five advanced surveillance systems contributed data on typhoid fever; 2 on paratyphoid fever. Regional typhoid fever incidence rates ranged from {\textless}0.1/100 000 cases/y in Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia to 724.6/100 000 cases/y in Sub-Saharan Africa. Regional paratyphoid incidence rates ranged from 0.8/100 000 cases/y in North Africa/Middle East to 77.4/100 000 cases/y in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. The estimated total number of typhoid fever episodes in 2010 was 13.5 million (interquartile range 9.1–17.8 million). The adjusted estimate accounting for the low sensitivity of blood cultures for isolation of the bacteria was 26.9 million (interquartile range 18.3–35.7 million) episodes. These findings are comparable to the most recent analysis of global typhoid fever morbidity, which reported crude and adjusted estimates of 10.8 million and 21.7 million typhoid fever episodes globally in 2000.

Conclusion
Typhoid fever remains a significant health burden, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Despite the availability of more recent data on both enteric fevers, additional research is needed in many regions, particularly Africa, Latin America and other developing countries.},

QUAST can evaluate assemblies both with a reference genome, as well as without a reference. QUAST produces many reports, summary tables and plots to help scientists in their research and in their publications. In this study, we used QUAST to compare several genome assemblers on three datasets. QUAST tables and plots for all of them are available in the Supplementary Material, and interactive versions of these reports are on the QUAST website.

	abstract = {Recent advances in single-cell genomics provide an alternative to gene-centric metagenomics studies, enabling whole genome sequencing of uncultivated bacteria. However, single-cell assembly projects are challenging due to (i) the highly non-uniform read coverage, and (ii) a greatly elevated number of chimeric reads and read pairs. While recently developed single-cell assemblers have addressed the former challenge, methods for assembling highly chimeric reads remain poorly explored. We present algorithms for identifying chimeric edges and resolving complex bulges in de Bruijn graphs, which significantly improve single-cell assemblies. We further describe applications of the single-cell assembler SPAdes to a new approach for capturing and sequencing “dark matter of life” that forms small pools of randomly selected single cells (called a mini-metagenome) and further sequences all genomes from the mini-metagenome at once. We demonstrate that SPAdes enables sequencing mini-metagenomes and benchmark it against various assemblers. On single-cell bacterial datasets, SPAdes improves on the recently developed E+V-SC and IDBA-UD assemblers specifically designed for single-cell sequencing. For standard (multicell) datasets, SPAdes also improves on A5, ABySS, CLC, EULER-SR, Ray, SOAPdenovo, and Velvet.},

	abstract = {EnteroBase is an integrated software environment which supports the identification of global population structures within several bacterial genera including pathogens. It currently contains more than 300,000 genomes that have been assembled from Illumina short reads from the genera Salmonella, Escherichia, Yersinia, Clostridiodes, Helicobacter, Vibrio, and Moraxella. With the recent introduction of hierarchical clustering of core genome MLST sequence types, EnteroBase now facilitates the identification of close relatives of bacteria within those genera inside of a few hours of uploading their short reads. It also supports private collaborations between groups of users, and the comparison of genomic data that were assembled from short reads with SNP calls that were extracted from metagenomic sequences. Here we provide an overview for its users on how EnteroBase works, what it can do, and its future prospects. This user’s guide is illustrated by three case studies ranging in scale from the miniscule (local transmission of Salmonella between neighboring social groups of badgers) through pandemic transmission of plague and microevolution of Yersinia pestis over the last 5,000 years to a novel, global overview of the population structure of all of Escherichia.},

	abstract = {Antibiotic resistance is a major problem in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, the causative agent of typhoid. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates are prevalent in parts of Asia and Africa and are often associated with the dominant H58 haplotype. Reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones is also widespread, and sporadic cases of resistance to third-generation cephalosporins or azithromycin have also been reported. Here, we report the first large-scale emergence and spread of a novel S. Typhi clone harboring resistance to three first-line drugs (chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) as well as fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins in Sindh, Pakistan, which we classify as extensively drug resistant (XDR). Over 300 XDR typhoid cases have emerged in Sindh, Pakistan, since November 2016. Additionally, a single case of travel-associated XDR typhoid has recently been identified in the United Kingdom. Whole-genome sequencing of over 80 of the XDR isolates revealed remarkable genetic clonality and sequence conservation, identified a large number of resistance determinants, and showed that these isolates were of haplotype H58. The XDR S. Typhi clone encodes a chromosomally located resistance region and harbors a plasmid encoding additional resistance elements, including the blaCTX-M-15 extended-spectrum β-lactamase, and carrying the qnrS fluoroquinolone resistance gene. This antibiotic resistance-associated IncY plasmid exhibited high sequence identity to plasmids found in other enteric bacteria isolated from widely distributed geographic locations. This study highlights three concerning problems: the receding antibiotic arsenal for typhoid treatment, the ability of S. Typhi to transform from MDR to XDR in a single step by acquisition of a plasmid, and the ability of XDR clones to spread globally.
IMPORTANCE Typhoid fever is a severe disease caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi. Antibiotic-resistant S. Typhi strains have become increasingly common. Here, we report the first large-scale emergence and spread of a novel extensively drug-resistant (XDR) S. Typhi clone in Sindh, Pakistan. The XDR S. Typhi is resistant to the majority of drugs available for the treatment of typhoid fever. This study highlights the evolving threat of antibiotic resistance in S. Typhi and the value of antibiotic susceptibility testing and whole-genome sequencing in understanding emerging infectious diseases. We genetically characterized the XDR S. Typhi to investigate the phylogenetic relationship between these isolates and a global collection of S. Typhi isolates and to identify multiple genes linked to antibiotic resistance. This S. Typhi clone harbored a promiscuous antibiotic resistance plasmid previously identified in other enteric bacteria. The increasing antibiotic resistance in S. Typhi observed here adds urgency to the need for typhoid prevention measures.},

	abstract = {One of the emerging conundrums of Campylobacter food-borne illness is the bacterial ability to survive stressful environmental conditions. We evaluated the heterogeneity among 90 C. jejuni and 21 C. coli isolates from different sources in Egypt with respect to biofilm formation capabilities (under microaerobic and aerobic atmosphere) and resistance to a range of stressors encountered along the food chain (aerobic stress, refrigeration, freeze-thaw, heat, peracetic acid, and osmotic stress). High prevalence (63\%) of hyper-aerotolerant (HAT) isolates was observed, exhibiting also a significantly high tolerance to heat, osmotic stress, refrigeration, and freeze-thaw stress, coupled with high biofilm formation ability which was clearly enhanced under aerobic conditions, suggesting a potential link between stress adaptation and biofilm formation. Most HAT multi-stress resistant and strong biofilm producing C. jejuni isolates belonged to host generalist clonal complexes (ST-21, ST-45, ST-48 and ST-206). These findings highlight the potential role of oxidative stress response systems in providing cross-protection (resistance to other multiple stress conditions) and enhancing biofilm formation in Campylobacter and suggest that selective pressures encountered in hostile environments have shaped the epidemiology of C. jejuni in Egypt by selecting the transmission of highly adapted isolates, thus promoting the colonization of multiple host species by important disease-causing lineages.},

Disease epidemiology in LMICs is different compared to high income countries like the USA or in Europe. Children in LMICs commonly have repeated and chronic infections even in the absence of symptoms, which can lead to deficits in early childhood development. In this study, we sequenced and characterized C. jejuni (n = 62) from a longitudinal cohort study of children under the age of 5 with and without diarrheal symptoms, and contextualized them within a global C. jejuni genome collection. Epidemiological differences in disease presentation were reflected in the genomes, specifically by the absence of some of the most common global disease-causing lineages. As in many other countries, poultry-associated strains were likely a major source of human infection but almost half of local disease cases (15 of 31) were attributable to genotypes that are rare outside of Peru. Asymptomatic infection was not limited to a single (or few) human adapted lineages but resulted from phylogenetically divergent strains suggesting an important role for host factors in the cryptic epidemiology of campylobacteriosis in LMICs.},

However, direct/indirect contacts with domestic animals may increase colonization by Campylobacter spp., which has been associated with Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED) and stunting. A cross-sectional study involving 102 randomly selected children between 12 and 16 months of age was conducted in rural eastern Ethiopia to establish prevalence rates of Campylobacter colonization, EED, and stunting, and evaluate potential risk factors. Data were collected between September and December 2018. The prevalence of EED and stunting was 50\% (95\% CI: 40-60\%) and 41\% (95\% CI: 32-51\%), respectively. Among enrolled children, 56\% had consumed some ASF in the previous 24 h; 47\% had diarrhea and 50\% had fever in the past 15 days. 54, 63, 71 or 43\% of households owned at least one chicken, cow/bull, goat, or sheep; 54 (53\%) households kept chickens indoors overnight and only half of these confined the animals. Sanitation was poor, with high levels of unimproved latrines and open defecation. Most households had access to an improved source of drinking water. The prevalence of Campylobacter colonization was 50\% (95\% CI: 41-60\%) by PCR. In addition to the thermotolerant species Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli and Campylobacter upsaliensis, non-thermotolerant species related to Campylobacter hyointestinalis and Campylobacter fetus were frequently detected by Meta-total RNA sequencing (MeTRS). Current breastfeeding and ASF consumption increased the odds of Campylobacter detection by PCR, while improved drinking water supply decreased the odds of EED. No risk factors were significantly associated with stunting. Further studies are necessary to better understand reservoirs and transmission pathways of Campylobacter spp. and their potential impact on child health.},

The incidence of campylobacteriosis in South America is greatly underestimated, mostly due to the lack of adequate diagnostic methods. Accordingly, there is limited genomic and epidemiological data from this region. In the present study, we performed a genome-wide analysis of the genetic diversity, virulence, and antimicrobial resistance of the largest collection of clinical C. jejuni and C. coli strains from Chile available to date (n = 81), collected in 2017-2019 in Santiago, Chile. This culture collection accounts for more than one third of the available genome sequences from South American clinical strains. cgMLST analysis identified high genetic diversity as well as 13 novel STs and alleles in both C. jejuni and C. coli. Pangenome and virulome analyses showed a differential distribution of virulence factors, including both plasmid and chromosomally encoded T6SSs and T4SSs. Resistome analysis predicted widespread resistance to fluoroquinolones, but low rates of erythromycin resistance. This study provides valuable genomic and epidemiological data and highlights the need for further genomic epidemiology studies in Chile and other South American countries to better understand molecular epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance of this emerging intestinal pathogen.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The factors affecting host-pathogen ecology in terms of the microbiome remain poorly studied. Chickens are a key source of protein with gut health heavily dependent on the complex microbiome which has key roles in nutrient assimilation and vitamin and amino acid biosynthesis. The chicken gut microbiome may be influenced by extrinsic production system parameters such as Placement Birds/m2 (stocking density), feed type and additives. Such parameters, in addition to on-farm biosecurity may influence performance and also pathogenic bacterial numbers such as Campylobacter. In this study, three different production systems 'Normal' (N), 'Higher Welfare' (HW) and 'Omega-3 Higher Welfare' (O) were investigated in an industrial farm environment at day 7 and day 30 with a range of extrinsic parameters correlating performance with microbial dynamics and Campylobacter presence.
RESULTS: Our data identified production system N as significantly dissimilar from production systems HW and O when comparing the prevalence of genera. An increase in Placement Birds/m2 density led to a decrease in environmental pressure influencing the microbial community structure. Prevalence of genera, such as Eisenbergiella within HW and O, and likewise Alistipes within N were representative. These genera have roles directly relating to energy metabolism, amino acid, nucleotide and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) utilisation. Thus, an association exists between consistent and differentiating parameters of the production systems that affect feed utilisation, leading to competitive exclusion of genera based on competition for nutrients and other factors. Campylobacter was identified within specific production system and presence was linked with the increased diversity and increased environmental pressure on microbial community structure. Addition of Omega-3 though did alter prevalence of specific genera, in our analysis did not differentiate itself from HW production system. However, Omega-3 was linked with a positive impact on weight gain.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results show that microbial communities in different industrial production systems are deterministic in elucidating the underlying biological confounders, and these recommendations are transferable to farm practices and diet manipulation leading to improved performance and better intervention strategies against Campylobacter within the food chain.

	abstract = {Campylobacteriosis is the leading foodborne bacterial diarrheal illness in many countries, with up to 80\% of human cases attributed to the avian reservoir. The only control strategies currently available are stringent on-farm biosecurity and carcass treatments. Heritable differences in the resistance of chicken lines to Campylobacter colonization have been reported and resistance-associated quantitative trait loci are emerging, although their impact on colonization appears modest. Recent studies indicated a protective role of the microbiota against colonization by Campylobacter in chickens. Furthermore, in murine models, differences in resistance to bacterial infections can be partially transferred between lines by transplantation of gut microbiota. In this study, we investigated whether heritable differences in colonization of inbred chicken lines by Campylobacter jejuni are associated with differences in cecal microbiota. We performed homologous and heterologous cecal microbiota transplants between line 61 (resistant) and line N (susceptible) by orally administering cecal contents collected from 3-week-old donors to day-of-hatch chicks. Recipient birds were challenged (day 21) with C. jejuni 11168H. In birds given homologous microbiota, the differential resistance of lines to C. jejuni colonization was reproduced. Contrary to our hypothesis, transfer of cecal microbiota from line 61 to line N significantly increased C. jejuni colonization. No significant difference in the overall composition of the cecal microbial communities of the two lines was identified, although line-specific differences for specific operational taxonomic units were identified. Our data suggest that while heritable differences in avian resistance to Campylobacter colonization exist, these are not explained by significant variation in the cecal microbiota.
IMPORTANCE Campylobacter is a leading cause of foodborne diarrheal disease worldwide. Poultry are a key source of human infections, but there are currently few effective measures against Campylobacter in poultry during production. One option to control Campylobacter may be to alter the composition of microbial communities in the avian intestines by introducing beneficial bacteria, which exclude the harmful ones. We previously described two inbred chicken lines which differ in resistance to intestinal colonization by Campylobacter. Here, we investigated the composition of the microbial communities in the gut of these lines and whether transferring gut bacteria between the resistant and susceptible lines alters their resistance to Campylobacter. No major differences in microbial populations were found, and resistance or susceptibility to colonization was not conferred by transferring gut bacteria between lines. The data suggest that gut microbiota did not play a role in resistance to Campylobacter colonization, at least in the lines used.},

	abstract = {Human campylobacteriosis is considered one of the most common foodborne diseases worldwide with poultry identified as the main source of infection accounting for 50-80\% of human cases. Highly virulent Campylobacter spp., positive for the Type VI secretion system (T6SS), which have an increased ability to adhere to and invade the host gastrointestinal epithelium are highly prevalent in poultry. Multidrug resistant strains of bacteria is rapidly evolving and therefore, new antimicrobials to supplement animal feed that are able to control Campylobacter species, are in great need. The work presented herein indicates that a novel phenolic antimicrobial, Auranta 3001, is able to reduce the adhesion and invasion of human intestinal epithelial cells (HCT-8) by two T6SS positive chicken isolates, C. jejuni RC039 (p{\textless}0.05) and C. coli RC013 (p{\textless}0.001). Exposure of C. jejuni RC039 and C. coli RC013 to Auranta 3001 downregulated the expression of hcp and cetB genes, known as important in the functionality of T6SS. Furthermore, the reduced adhesion and invasion is associated with a significant decrease in bacterial motility of both isolates (p{\textless}0.05 – p{\textless}0.001) in vitro. Most importantly our in vivo results show that Auranta 3001 is able to reduce cecum colonisation levels from log 8 CFU/ml to log 2 CFU/ml for C. jejuni RC039 and from log 7 CFU/ml to log 2 CFU/ml for C. coli RC013. In conclusion this novel antimicrobial is able to reduce the pathogenic properties of T6SS campylobacters in vitro and also to decrease colonisation in vivo.},

	abstract = {An in-depth analysis was performed on Swedish broiler producers that had delivered chickens with Campylobacter to slaughter over several years, in order to identify possible transmission routes and formulate effective measures to prevent chickens being colonized with Campylobacter. Between 2017 and 2019, 626 samples were collected at farm level and Campylobacter was isolated from 133 (21.2\%). All C. jejuni and C. coli isolated from these samples were whole-genome sequenced, together with isolates from the corresponding cecum samples at slaughter (n = 256). Core genome multi-locus sequence typing (cgMLST) analysis, using schemes consisting of 1140 and 529 genes for C. jejuni and C. coli, respectively, revealed that nearby cattle, contaminated drinking water, water ponds, transport crates, and parent flocks were potential reservoirs of Campylobacter. A novel feature compared with previous studies is that measures were implemented and tested during the work. These contributed to a nationwide decrease in Campylobacter-positive flocks from 15.4\% in 2016 to 4.6\% in 2019, which is the lowest ever rate in Sweden. To conclude, there are different sources and routes of Campylobacter transmission to chickens from different broiler producers, and individual measures must be taken by each producer to prevent Campylobacter colonization of chickens.},

At the time of thinning, the catching crew, transportation vehicles, forklift, and transport containers were sampled for the presence of Campylobacter. Samples were cultivated; presumed positive isolates were confirmed by PCR. The isolates were molecularly typed by flaA restriction analysis and pulsed field gel electrophoresis. Results show that all flocks were thinned using Campylobacter-contaminated equipment and materials. One-third of the broiler flocks became colonized after thinning. In 67\% of the colonization cases, identical strains were found matching those of container systems, transport trucks, and/or forklifts.

Contamination of chicken meat with digesta from C. jejuni-positive birds during slaughter and processing is a key route of transmission to humans through the food chain. Colonization of chickens with C. jejuni elicits host innate immune responses that may be modulated by dietary additives to provide a reduction in the number of campylobacters colonizing the gastrointestinal tract and thereby reduce the likelihood of human exposure to an infectious dose. Here we report the effects of prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharide (GOS) on broiler chickens colonized with C. jejuni when challenged at either an early stage in development at six days of age or twenty days old when campylobacters are frequently detected in commercial flocks. GOS-fed birds had increased growth performance, but the levels of C. jejuni colonizing the cecal pouches were unchanged irrespective of the age of challenge. Dietary GOS modulated the immune response to C. jejuni colonization by increasing cytokine IL-17A expression whilst reducing IL-17F. Correspondingly, reduced diversity of the cecal microbiota was associated with Campylobacter colonization in GOS-fed birds. In birds challenged at six days-old the reduction in microbial diversity was accompanied by an increase in the relative abundance of Escherichia spp. Whilst immuno-modulation of the Th17 pro-inflammatory response did not prevent C. jejuni colonization of the intestinal tract of broiler chickens, the study highlights the potential for combinations of prebiotics and specific competitors (synbiotics) to engage with the host innate immunity to reduce pathogen burdens.},

Trait heritability was modest but significant (h2 = 0.11 ± 0.03). Results confirmed quantitative trait loci (QTL) on chromosomes 14 and 16 previously identified in inbred chicken lines, and detected two additional QTLs on chromosomes 19 and 26. RNA-Seq analysis of broilers at the extremes of colonisation phenotype identified differentially transcribed genes within the QTL on chromosome 16 and proximal to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus. We identified strong cis-QTLs located within MHC suggesting the presence of cis-acting variation in MHC class I and II and BG genes. Pathway and network analyses implicated cooperative functional pathways and networks in colonisation, including those related to antigen presentation, innate and adaptive immune responses, calcium, and renin–angiotensin signalling.

	abstract = {Cattle are an established reservoir of the foodborne bacterial pathogen Campylobacter jejuni. Our six-month study aimed to evaluate sources and pathways governing long-term presence of C. jejuni in a pasture-based dairy herd. C. jejuni was detected in all sample types (soil, pasture, stock drinking water, bird, rodents and cow faeces). It was persistently detected from cow (54\%; 49/90 samples) and bird (36\%; 77/211) faeces. Genetic comparison of 252 C. jejuni isolates identified 30 Multi-Locus Sequence Types (ST). ST-61 and ST-42 were persistent in the herd and accounted for 43\% of the cow isolates. They were also detected on pasture collected from fields both recently and not recently grazed, indicating that grazed pasture is an important pathway and reservoir for horizontal transmission among cows. ST-61 accounted for 9\% of the bird isolates and was detected at four of the six sampling events, suggesting that bird populations might contribute to the cycling of ruminant-adapted genotypes on-farm. Overall, the results indicated that management of grazed pasture and supplementary feed contaminated by bird droppings could be targeted to effectively reduce transmission of C. jejuni to dairy herds, the farm environment and ultimately to humans.},

	abstract = {Campylobacter fetus is currently classified into three main subspecies, but only two of these, C. fetus subspecies fetus and C. fetus subsp. venerealis originate principally from ruminants where they inhabit different niches and cause distinct pathogenicity. Their importance as pathogens in international trade and reporting is also different yet the criteria defining these properties have never been fully substantiated nor understood. The situation is further compromised because the ability to differentiate between these two closely related C. fetus subspecies has traditionally been performed by phenotypic characterisation of isolates, methods which are limited in scope, time-consuming, tedious, and often yield inconsistent results, thereby leading to isolate misidentification. The development of robust genetic markers that could enable rapid discrimination between C. fetus subsp. fetus and subsp. venerealis has also been challenging due to limited differences in the gene complement of their genomes, high levels of sequence repetition, the small number of closed genome sequences available and the lack of standardisation of the discriminatory biochemical tests employed for comparative purposes. To yield a better understanding of the genomic differences that define these C. fetus strains, seven isolates were exhaustively characterised phenotypically and genetically and compared with seven previously well characterised isolates. Analysis of these 14 C. fetus samples clearly illustrated that adaption by C. fetus subsp. venerealis to the bovine reproductive tract correlated with increasing genome length and plasticity due to the acquisition and propagation of several mobile elements including prophages, transposons and plasmids harbouring virulence factors. Significant differences in the repertoire of the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats)-cas system of all C. fetus strains was also found. We therefore suggest that a deficiency in this adaptive immune system may have permitted the emergence of extensive genome plasticity and led to changes in host tropism through gene disruption and/or changes in gene expression. Notable differences in the sub-species complement of DNA adenine methylase genes may also have an impact. These data will facilitate future studies to better understand the precise genetic differences that underlie the phenotypic and virulence differences between these animal pathogens and may identify additional markers useful for diagnosis and sub-typing.},

To better understand the impact of breastfeeding on Campylobacter infection in infants in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, we examined fecal microbial compositions, bacterial isolates, and their carbohydrate metabolic pathways in Campylobacter-positive infants {\textless}1 year of age from the Global Enterics Multicenter Study. Exclusively breastfed infants with diarrhea exhibited high Campylobacter abundances, and this negatively correlated with bacterial carbohydrate metabolism. Although C. jejuni and Campylobacter coli are prevalent among these infants, the second most abundant Campylobacter species was a new species, which we named "Candidatus Campylobacter infans." Asymptomatic Campylobacter carriers also possess significantly different proportions of specific gut microbes compared to diarrheal cases. These findings provide insight into Campylobacter infections in infants in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia and help inform strategies aimed at eliminating campylobacteriosis in these areas.IMPORTANCECampylobacter is the primary cause of bacterial diarrhea in the United States and can lead to the development of the postinfectious autoimmune neuropathy known as Guillain-Barré syndrome. Also, drug-resistant campylobacters are becoming a serious concern both locally and abroad. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), infection with Campylobacter is linked to high rates of morbidity, growth stunting, and mortality in children, and breastfeeding is important for infant nutrition, development, and protection against infectious diseases. In this study, we examined the relationship between breastfeeding and Campylobacter infection and demonstrate the increased selection for C. jejuni and C. coli strains unable to metabolize fucose. We also identify a new Campylobacter species coinfecting these infants with a high prevalence in five of the seven countries in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia examined. These findings indicate that more detailed studies are needed in LMICs to understand the Campylobacter infection process in order to devise a strategy for eliminating this pathogenic microbe.},

Previous reports have observed a high genetic diversity within isolates from diarrhoeic and IBD patients and from healthy controls (HC), and division of isolates into two major genomospecies (GS1 and GS2). The aim of this study was to describe genetic diversity in 80 recently cultivated MC biopsy and faecal isolates of C. concisus by multi-locus sequence typing (MLST); and to compare the phylogenetic relatedness to 102 isolates from diarrhoeic and IBD patients and HCs by k-mer-based distance estimation. MLST revealed high genetic diversity in MC isolates with 72 novel sequence types. K-mer divided MC isolates into two distinct clusters (cluster 1 n = 21, cluster 2 n = 49), with a significantly higher prevalence of cluster 2 isolates in biopsies than in faeces, p = 0.009. K-mer divided the 182 isolates into two major phylogenetic clusters: cluster 1 (GS1 isolates) and cluster 2 (GS2 isolates), which further differentiated into three subgroups. Cluster 1 and the three cluster 2 subgroups were each distinctive in mean genome size and GC count. Isolates from all disease phenotypes were present in cluster 1 and cluster 2 subgroup 2 and 3, whereas cluster 2 subgroup 1 only contained isolates restricted to patients with ulcerative colitis (n = 10) and HC (n = 4).},

Currently, only three complete C. concisus genomes are available and more complete C. concisus genomes are needed in order to better understand the genomic features and pathogenicity of this emerging pathogen. DNA extracted from 22 C. concisus strains were subjected to Oxford Nanopore genome sequencing. Complete genome assembly was performed using Nanopore genome data in combination with previously reported short-read Illumina data. Genome features of complete C. concisus genomes were analysed using bioinformatic tools. The enteric disease associations of C. concisus plasmids were examined using 239 C. concisus strains and confirmed using PCRs. Proteomic analysis was used to examine T6SS secreted proteins. We successfully obtained 13 complete C. concisus genomes in this study. Analysis of 16 complete C. concisus genomes (3 from public databases) identified multiple novel plasmids. pSma1 plasmid was found to be associated with severe UC. Sec-SRP, Tat and T6SS were found to be the main secretion systems in C. concisus and proteomic data showed a functional T6SS despite the lack of ClpV. T4SS was found in 25\% of complete C. concisus genomes. This study also found that GS2 strains had larger genomes and higher GC content than GS1 strains and more often had plasmids. In conclusion, this study provides fundamental genomic data for understanding C. concisus plasmids, genomospecies features, evolution, secretion systems and pathogenicity.},

	abstract = {Campylobacter, a common foodborne human pathogen, is considered sensitive to oxygen. Recently, aerotolerant (AT) Campylobacter jejuni with the ability to survive under aerobic stress has been reported. Here, we investigated the prevalence of hyper-aerotolerant (HAT) Campylobacter coli from duck sources (118 carcasses and meat) and its characteristics to assess potential impacts on public health. Half of 56 C. coli isolates were HAT and most harbored various virulence genes including flaA, cadF, cdtA, ceuB, and wlaN. Moreover, 98.2\% of C. coli isolates showed resistance to quinolones, including ciprofloxacin (CIP), and nine (16.1\%) showed high-level resistance to ciprofloxacin (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration, MIC \&ge; 32 \&mu;g/mL) and most of these were HAT. Based on genetic relatedness between C. coli from duck sources and those from human sources (PubMLST and NCBI), HAT isolates sharing the same MLST sequence types were significantly more prevalent than those not sharing the same sequence types as those from human sources. Therefore, HAT C. coli is prevalent in duck sources, and is most likely transmitted to humans through the food chain given its aerotolerance. This being so, it might pose a threat to public health given its virulence and antimicrobial resistance (AMR). This study will assist in improving control strategies to reduce farm-to-table HAT C. coli transmission to humans.},

	abstract = {Campylobacter jejuni, the most frequent cause of food-borne bacterial gastroenteritis, is a fastidious organism when grown in the laboratory. Oxygen is required for growth, despite the presence of the metabolic mechanism for anaerobic respiration. Amino acid auxotrophies are variably reported and energy metabolism can be through several electron donor/ acceptor combinations. Overall, the picture is one of a flexible, but vulnerable metabolism. To understand Campylobacter metabolism, we have constructed a fully curated, metabolic model for the reference organism M1 (our variant is M1cam) and validated through laboratory experiments. Our results show that M1cam is auxotrophic for methionine, niacinamide and pantothenate. There are complete biosynthesis pathways for all amino acids except methionine and it can produce energy, but not biomass, in the absence of oxygen. M1cam will grow in DMEM/F-12 defined media but, not in the previously published Campylobacter specific defined media tested. Using the model, we identified potential auxotrophies and substrates that may improve growth. With this information, we have designed a simple defined media containing inorganic salts, the auxotrophic substrates, L-methionine, niacinamide and pantothenate, and pyruvate and additional amino acids L-cysteine, L-serine and L-glutamine for growth enhancement. Our defined media supports 1.75-fold higher growth rate than Brucella broth after 48 hours at 37 ◦ C and sustains growth of other C. jejuni strains. This media can be used to design reproducible assays that can help to better understand adaptation, stress resistance and virulence mechanisms of this pathogen. We have shown that with a well curated metabolic model it is possible to design a media to grow this fastidious organism. This has implications for the investigation of new Campylobacter 24 species defined through metagenomics, such as C. infans.},

	abstract = {Microbiological surveillance of the food chain plays a critical role in improving our understanding of the distribution and circulation of food-borne pathogens along the farm to fork continuum towards the development of interventions to reduce the burden of illness. The application of molecular subtyping to bacterial isolates collected through surveillance has led to the identification of strains posing the greatest risk to public health. Past evidence suggests that enrichment methods for Campylobacter jejuni, a leading bacterial foodborne pathogen worldwide, may lead to the differential recovery of subtypes, obscuring our ability to infer the composition of a mixed-strain sample and potentially biasing prevalence estimates in surveillance data. To assess the extent of potential selection bias resulting from enrichment-based isolation methods, we compared enriched and non-enriched isolation of mixed subtype cultures of C. jejuni, followed by subtype-specific enumeration using both colony plate-counts and digital droplet PCR. Results differed from the null hypothesis that similar proportions of C. jejuni subtypes are recovered from enrichment and non-enrichment protocols. Our results also indicated a significant effect of subtype cluster frequency on isolation frequency post-recovery, with the recovery of more common subtypes being consistently favoured. This bias was exacerbated when an enrichment step was included in the isolation procedure. Taken together, our results emphasize the importance of selecting multiple colonies per sample, and where possible, the use of both enrichment and non-enrichment isolation procedures to maximize the likelihood of recovering multiple subtypes present in a sample. Moreover, the effects of subtype-specific recovery bias should be considered in the interpretation of strain prevalence data towards improved risk assessment from microbiological surveillance data.},

Raccoons (Procyon lotor), which live at the interface of rural, urban, and more natural environments, are ideal subjects for exploring the potential role that wildlife play in the epidemiology of campylobacteriosis. We studied the prevalence and genetic diversity of Campylobacter from live-captured raccoons on five swine farms and five conservation areas in southwest Ontario. From 2011 – 2013, we collected fecal swabs (n=1096) from raccoons, and (n=50) manure pit samples from the swine farm environment. We subtyped the resulting Campylobacter isolates (n=581) using Comparative Genomic Fingerprinting (CGF) and 114 distinct subtypes were observed, including 96 and 18 subtypes among raccoon and manure pit isolates, respectively. Campylobacter prevalence in raccoons was 46.3\%, with 98.7\% of isolates recovered identified as C. jejuni. Novel raccoon-specific CGF subtypes (n=40/96) accounted for 24.6\% (n=143/581) of Campylobacter isolates collected in this study. Our results also show that C. jejuni is readily acquired and lost in this wild raccoon population and that a high Campylobacter prevalence is observed despite transient carriage typically lasting 30 days or fewer. Moreover, although raccoons appeared to be colonized by species-adapted subtypes, they also harboured agriculture-associated genotypes that accounted for the majority of isolates observed (66.4\%) and that are strongly associated with human infections. This suggests that raccoons may act as vectors in the transmission of clinically-relevant C. jejuni subtypes at the interface of rural, urban, and more natural environments.},

To date, Tet(O), a ribosomal protection protein, is the only confirmed Tet resistance determinant in Campylobacter spp. Here, we reported the detection and characterization of a novel Tet resistance element in Campylobacter spp. of chicken origin. This gene is identified to be a variant of tet(L), which encodes an efflux pump for Tet resistance. The variant was detected in 14 of the 82 tetracycline-resistant Campylobacter isolates collected from chickens in Henan, China. Cloning of the tet(L) variant into tetracycline-susceptible Campylobacter jejuni NCTC 11168 confirmed its function in conferring resistance to tetracycline and doxycycline. In addition, this tet(L) variant elevated the MIC (4-fold increase) of tigecycline in the heterologous Escherichia coli host. Sequencing analysis indicated the tet(L) variant was located within a multidrug-resistance genomic island (MDRGI) containing tet(L) variant IS1216E-ORF1-fexA-Δtnp-IS1216E-tet(O)-tnpV-repA This MDRGI is inserted into conserved gene potB on the chromosome. Multilocus sequence type (MLST) analysis revealed that both clonal expansion and horizontal transfer were involved in the dissemination of the tet(L) variant.

	abstract = {The use of antimicrobials in human and veterinary medicine has coincided with a rise in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the food-borne pathogens Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli. Faecal contamination from the main reservoir hosts (livestock, especially poultry) is the principal route of human infection but little is known about the spread of AMR among source and sink populations. In particular, questions remain about how Campylobacter resistomes interact between species and hosts, and the potential role of sewage as a conduit for the spread of AMR. Here, we investigate the genomic variation associated with AMR in 168 C. jejuni and 92 C. coli strains isolated from humans, livestock and urban effluents in Spain. AMR was tested in vitro and isolate genomes were sequenced and screened for putative AMR genes and alleles. Genes associated with resistance to multiple drug classes were observed in both species and were commonly present in multidrug-resistant genomic islands (GIs), often located on plasmids or mobile elements. In many cases, these loci had alleles that were shared among C. jejuni and C. coli consistent with horizontal transfer. Our results suggest that specific antibiotic resistance genes have spread among Campylobacter isolated from humans, animals and the environment.},

	abstract = {Genomic analyses were performed on florfenicol-resistant (FFNr) Campylobacter coli isolates recovered from cattle, and the cfr(C) gene-associated multidrug resistance (MDR) plasmid was characterized. Sixteen FFNr C. coli isolates recovered between 2013 and 2018 from beef cattle were sequenced using MiSeq. Genomes and plasmids were found to be closed for three of the isolates using the PacBio system. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome and the structures of MDR plasmids were investigated. Conjugation experiments were performed to determine the transferability of cfr(C)-associated MDR plasmids. The spectrum of resistance encoded by the cfr(C) gene was further investigated by agar dilution antimicrobial susceptibility testing. All 16 FFNr isolates were MDR and exhibited coresistance to ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, clindamycin, and tetracycline. All isolates shared the same resistance genotype, carrying aph (3′)-III, hph, ΔaadE (truncated), blaOXA-61, cfr(C), and tet(O) genes plus a mutation of GyrA (T86I). The cfr(C), aph (3′)-III, hph, ΔaadE, and tet(O) genes were colocated on transferable MDR plasmids ranging in size from 48 to 50 kb. These plasmids showed high sequence homology with the pTet plasmid and carried several Campylobacter virulence genes, including virB2, virB4, virB5, VirB6, virB7, virB8, virb9, virB10, virB11, and virD4. The cfr(C) gene conferred resistance to florfenicol (8 to 32 μg/ml), clindamycin (512 to 1,024 μg/ml), linezolid (128 to 512 μg/ml), and tiamulin (1,024 μg/ml). Phylogenetic analysis showed SNP differences ranging from 11 to 2,248 SNPs among the 16 isolates. The results showed that the cfr(C) gene located in the conjugative pTet MDR/virulence plasmid is present in diverse strains, where it confers high levels of resistance to several antimicrobials, including linezolid, a critical drug for treating infections by Gram-positive bacteria in humans. This report highlights the power of genomic antimicrobial resistance surveillance to uncover the intricacies of transmissible coresistance and provides information that is needed for accurate risk assessment and mitigation strategies.
IMPORTANCE Campylobacter is a leading cause of foodborne diarrheal illness worldwide, with more than one million cases each year in the United States alone. The global emergence of antimicrobial resistance in this pathogen has become a growing public health concern. Florfenicol-resistant (FFNr) Campylobacter has been very rare in the United States. In this study, we employed whole-genome sequencing to characterize 16 multidrug-resistant Campylobacter coli isolates recovered from cattle in the United States. A gene [cfr(C)] was found to be responsible for resistance not only to florfenicol but also to several other antimicrobials, including linezolid, a critical drug for treating infections by Gram-positive bacteria in humans. The results showed that cfr(C) is located in a conjugative pTet MDR/virulence plasmid. This report highlights the power of antimicrobial resistance surveillance to uncover the intricacies of transmissible coresistance and provides information that is needed for accurate risk assessment and mitigation strategies.},

Use of various comparative genomics analysis techniques enables to find intrinsic and acquired genes associated with phenotypic antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Campylobacter jejuni genome sequences with exceptionally high-level multidrug resistance. In this study, we used whole genome sequences of seven C. jejuni to identify isolate-specific genomic features associated with resistance and virulence determinants and their role in multidrug resistance (MDR). All isolates were phenotypically highly resistant to tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, and ceftriaxone (MIC range from 64 to ≥256 µg/mL). Besides, two C. jejuni isolates were resistant to gentamicin, and one was resistant to erythromycin. The extensive drug-resistance profiles were confirmed for the two C. jejuni isolates assigned to ST-4447 (CC179). The most occurring genetic antimicrobial-resistance determinants were tetO, beta-lactamase, and multidrug efflux pumps. In this study, mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were detected in genomic islands carrying genes that confer resistance to MDR, underline their importance for disseminating antibiotic resistance in C. jejuni. The genomic approach showed a diverse distribution of virulence markers, including both plasmids and phage sequences that serve as horizontal gene transfer tools. The study findings describe in silico prediction of AMR and virulence genetics determinants combined with phenotypic AMR detection in multidrug-resistant C. jejuni isolates from Lithuania.},

	abstract = {Rapid developments in the field of whole genome sequencing (WGS) make in silico antimicrobial resistance (AMR) a target within reach. Campylobacter jejuni is a leading cause of foodborne infections in Israel with increasing rates of resistance. We applied WGS analysis to study the prevalence and genetic basis of AMR in 263 C. jejuni human and veterinary representative isolates retrieved from a national collection during 2003-2012. We evaluated the prediction of phenotypic AMR from genomic data. Genomes were screened by the NCBI AMRFinderPlus and the BioNumerics tools for acquired AMR genes and point mutations. The results were compared to phenotypic resistance determined by broth microdilution. The most prevalent resistant determinants were the multi-drug efflux transporter gene cmeABC (100\%), the tetracycline resistance tet(O) gene (82.1\%), the quinolone resistance gyrA T861 point mutation (75.7\%), and the aadE streptomycin resistance gene. A variety of 12 known β lactam resistance genes (blaOXA variants) were detected in 241 (92\%) isolates, the most prevalent being blaOXA-193, blaOXA-461, and blaOXA-580 (56, 16, and 7\%, respectively). Other aminoglycoside resistance genes and the macrolide resistance point mutation were rare ({\textless}1\%). The overall correlation rate between WGS-based genotypic prediction and phenotypic resistance was 98.8\%, sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values being 98.0, 99.3, 99.1, and 98.5\%, respectively. wgMLST-based phylogeny indicated a high level of clonality and clustering among the studied isolates. Closely related isolates that were part of a genetic cluster (single linkage distance ≤ 15 alleles) based on wgMLST phylogeny mostly shared a homogenous AMR determinant profile. This was observed in 18 of 20 (90.0\%) clusters within clonal complex-21, suggesting clonal expansion of resistant isolates. Strong association to lineage was noted for the aadE gene and the various blaOXA genes. High resistance rates to tetracycline and quinolones and a low resistance rate to macrolides were detected among the Israeli C. jejuni isolates. While a high genotypic-phenotypic correlation was found, some resistance phenotypes could not be predicted by the presence of AMR determinants, and particularly not the level of resistance. WGS-based prediction of antimicrobial resistance in C. jejuni requires further optimization in order to integrate this approach in the routine workflow of public health laboratories for foodborne surveillance.},

Maximal invasion of host cells by C. jejuni requires cell binding as well as delivery of the Cia proteins (Campylobacter invasion antigens) to the host cell cytosol via the flagellum. Here, we show that CiaD binds to the host cell protein IQGAP1 (a Ras GTPase-activating-like protein), thus displacing RacGAP1 from the IQGAP1 complex. This, in turn, leads to the unconstrained activity of the small GTPase Rac1, which is known to have roles in actin reorganization and internalization of C. jejuni. Our results represent the identification of a host cell protein targeted by a flagellar secreted effector protein and demonstrate that C. jejuni-stimulated Rac signaling is dependent on IQGAP1.},

However, the specific mechanism still remains unknown. In this study, RNA-Seq, EMSAs, ChIP-qPCR and β-Galactosidase assays were performed to elucidate the novel interactions between FlhF and genes involved in flagellar synthesis. Results showed that FlhF has an overall influence on the transcription of flagellar genes with an flhF mutant displaying down-regulation of most flagellar related genes. FlhF can directly bind to the flgI promoter to regulate its expression, which has significant expression change in an flhF mutant. The possible binding site of FlhF to the flgI promoter was explored by continuously narrowing the flgI promoter region and performing further point mutations. Meanwhile, FlhF can directly bind to the promoters of rpoD, flgS, and fliA encoding early flagellin regulators, thereby directly or indirectly regulating the synthesis of class I, II, and III flagellar genes, respectively. Collectively, this study demonstrates that FlhF may directly regulate the transcription of flagellar genes by binding to their promoters as a transcriptional regulator, which will be helpful in understanding the mechanism of FlhF in flagellar biosynthetic and bacterial flagellation in general.},

Traits were analysed with genotypic and phenotypic methods, including PCR and extracellular matrix protein (ECMP) binding, adhesion, and invasion capacities. Results were studied alongside patient symptoms, but no distinct links with them could be determined. Since the capacity of C. jejuni to invade host epithelial cells is one of its most enigmatic attributes, a high throughput transcriptomic analysis was performed in the third hour of internalization with a C. jejuni strain originally isolated from bloody diarrhoea. Characteristic groups of genes were significantly upregulated, outlining a survival strategy of internalized C. jejuni comprising genes related (1) to oxidative stress; (2) to a protective sheath formed by the capsule, LOS, N-, and O- glycosylation systems; (3) to dynamic metabolic activity supported by different translocases and the membrane-integrated component of the flagellar apparatus; and (4) to hitherto unknown genes.},

In contrast to E. coli CsrA, whose activity is modulated by binding to small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs), C. jejuni CsrA activity is controlled by binding to the predicted flagellar chaperone FliW. In this study, we identified the FliW binding site on CsrA. Deletion of the C-terminus of C. jejuni CsrA, which is extended relative to sRNA-binding CsrA proteins, abrogated FliW binding. Bacterial two-hybrid experiments were used to assess the interaction of FliW with wild type CsrA and mutants thereof, in which every amino acid was individually mutated. Two CsrA mutations (V51A and N55A) resulted in a significant decrease in FliW binding. The V51A and N55A mutants also showed a decrease in CsrA-FliW complex formation, as assessed by size exclusion chromatography and surface plasmon resonance. These residues were highly conserved in bacterial species containing CsrA orthologs whose activities are predicted to be regulated by FliW. The location of FliW binding was immediately adjacent to the two RNA-binding sites of CsrA homodimer, suggesting the model that FliW binding to CsrA modulates its ability to bind to its mRNA targets either by steric hindrance, electrostatic repulsion, or by altering the overall structure of the RNA binding sites.},

Chemoreceptors enable motile bacteria to avoid adverse conditions, find favorable niches, and adapt to the host. Elgamoudi et al. characterized the chemoreceptor Tlp10 from Campylobacter jejuni, an avian gut commensal that causes enteritis when consumed in undercooked poultry or contaminated water. Through two ligand-binding sites, Tlp10 sensed some amino acids, organic acids, and sugars as chemorepellents and others as chemoattractants. C. jejuni expressing a Tlp10 mutant lacking the ligand-binding domain were compromised in biofilm formation, adhesion to human intestinal cells, and colonization of the chicken gut. Similar ligand-binding domains were found in other pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria, suggesting that this unusual type of chemoreceptor may help bacteria find optimal niches in various contexts.

	abstract = {Biofilms of the gastroenteric pathogen C. jejuni may serve an important role in the transmission of infection from reservoirs of infection to humans. Herein, we undertook a combinatorial approach examining differential gene expression and protein abundance during biofilm formation in C. jejuni. Biofilms induced a substantial rearrangement of the C. jejuni transcriptome and proteome, with {\textasciitilde}600 genes differentially expressed when compared to planktonic cells. Genes and proteins induced in biofilms were involved in iron metabolism and acquisition, cell division, glycan production and attachment, while those repressed were associated with metabolism, amino acid usage, and large tracts of the chemotaxis pathway. We further examined the role of chemotaxis in C. jejuni biofilm formation by examining isogenic strains with deletions of the cheV and cheW signal transduction genes. Both ∆cheV and ∆cheW exhibited a significant decrease in directed motility when compared to wild-type C. jejuni as well as demonstrating an increase in autoagglutination ability and biofilm formation. A subtle difference was also observed between the phenotypes of ∆cheV and ∆cheW mutants, both in motility and biofilm formation. This suggests roles for CheV and CheW and may present signal transduction as a potential method for modulating C. jejuni biofilm formation.},

	abstract = {Campylobacter jejuni, a zoonotic pathogen that frequently colonizes poultry, possesses two Microbial Surface Components Recognizing Adhesive Matrix Molecule(s) (MSCRAMMs) termed CadF and FlpA that bind to the glycoprotein fibronectin (FN). Previous to this study, it was not known whether the CadF and FlpA proteins were functionally redundant or if both were required to potentiate host cell binding and signaling processes. We addressed these questions by generating a complete repertoire of cadF and flpA mutants and complemented isolates, and performing multiple phenotypic assays. Both CadF and FlpA were found to be necessary for the maximal binding of C. jejuni to FN and to host cells. In addition, both CadF and FlpA are required for the delivery of the C. jejuni Cia effector proteins into the cytosol of host target cells, which in turn activates the MAPK signaling pathway (Erk 1/2) that is required for the C. jejuni invasion of host cells. These data demonstrate the non-redundant and bi-functional nature of these two C. jejuni FN-binding proteins. Taken together, the C. jejuni CadF and FlpA adhesins facilitate the binding of C. jejuni to the host cells, permit delivery of effector proteins into the cytosol of a host target cell, and aid in the rewiring of host cell signaling pathways to alter host cell behavior.},

	abstract = {Reducing the Campylobacter load on poultry carcasses represents a major tasks for the industry as its ability to reduce their presence is of major interest aiming to increase consumer safety. This study investigated the ability of a mixture of natural antimicrobials (A3001) to reduce the adherence of the T6SS+/− C. coli isolates (NC1hcp-, NC2 hcp- and NC3 hcp+) to chicken neck skin and whole carcasses. Overall, the antimicrobial mixture induced a significant reduction in the capability of our C. coli isolates to colonise the chicken skin (p {\textless} 0.05) and carcasses (p {\textless} 0.0001) but with a greater effect (≈3 log reduction) on the NC3 isolate. Using the HCT-8 in vitro infection model we also show that at a concentration of 0.5\% A3001, the impact on the NC3 isolate is accompanied by the downregulation of the hcp gene (p = 0.0001), and indicator of the T6SS presence. The results described herein also indicated that these isolates are highly resistant to H2O2, up to 20 mM, suggesting a high resilience to environmental stresses. In summary our study shows that natural antimicrobials can reduce the ability of T6SS positive chicken C. coli isolates to adhere to chicken skin or to the whole carcass and to infect epithelial cells in vitro and could be considered a potential intervention at processor level.},

	abstract = {The role of the Type VI secretion system (T6SS) in Campylobacter jejuni is poorly understood despite an increasing prevalence of the T6SS in recent C. jejuni isolates in humans and chickens. The T6SS is a contractile secretion machinery capable of delivering effectors that can play a role in host colonisation and niche establishment. During host colonisation, C. jejuni is exposed to oxidative stress in the host gastrointestinal tract, and in other bacteria the T6SS has been linked with the oxidative stress response. In this study, comparisons of whole genome sequences of a novel human isolate 488 with previously sequenced strains revealed a single highly conserved T6SS cluster shared between strains isolated from humans and chickens. The presence of a functional T6SS in the 488 wild-type strain is indicated by expression of T6SS genes and secretion of the effector TssD. Increased expression of oxidative stress response genes katA, sodB, and ahpC, and increased oxidative stress resistance in 488 wild-type strain suggest T6SS is associated with oxidative stress response. The role of the T6SS in interactions with host cells is explored using in vitro and in vivo models, and the presence of the T6SS is shown to increase C. jejuni cytotoxicity in the Galleria mellonella infection model. In biologically relevant models, the T6SS enhances C. jejuni interactions with and invasion of chicken primary intestinal cells and enhances the ability of C. jejuni to colonise chickens. This study demonstrates that the C. jejuni T6SS provides defence against oxidative stress and enhances host colonisation, and highlights the importance of the T6SS during in vivo survival of T6SS-positive C. jejuni strains.},

	abstract = {Campylobacter jejuni outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) contain numerous virulence-associated proteins including the cytolethal distending toxin and three serine proteases. As C. jejuni lacks the classical virulence-associated secretion systems of other enteric pathogens that deliver effectors directly into target cells, OMVs may have a particularly important role in virulence. C. jejuni OMV production is stimulated by the presence of physiological concentrations of the bile salt sodium taurocholate (ST) through an unknown mechanism. The maintenance of lipid asymmetry (MLA) pathway has been implicated in a novel mechanism for OMV biogenesis, open to regulation by host signals. In this study we investigated the role of the MLA pathway in C. jejuni OMV biogenesis with ST as a potential regulator. OMV production was quantified by analysing protein and lipid concentrations of OMV preparations and OMV particle counts produced by nanoparticle tracking analysis. Mutation of mlaA which encodes the outer membrane component of the MLA pathway significantly increased OMV production compared to the wild-type strain. Detergent sensitivity and membrane permeability assays confirmed the increased OMV production was not due to changes in membrane stability. The presence of 0.2\% (w/v) ST increased wild-type OMV production and reduced OMV size, but did not further stimulate mlaA mutant OMV production or significantly alter mlaA mutant OMV size. qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that the presence of ST decreased expression of both mlaA and mlaC in C. jejuni wild-type strains 11168 and 488. Collectively the data in this study suggests C. jejuni can regulate OMV production in response to host gut signals through changes in expression of the MLA pathway. As the gut bile composition is dependent on both diet and the microbiota, this study highlights the potential importance of diet and lifestyle factors on the varying disease presentations associated with gut pathogen infection.},

	abstract = {Campylobacter jejuni, the leading cause of bacterial acute gastroenteritis worldwide, secretes an arsenal of virulence-associated proteins within outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). C. jejuni OMVs contain three serine proteases (HtrA, Cj0511, and Cj1365c) that cleave the intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) tight and adherens junction proteins occludin and E-cadherin, promoting enhanced C. jejuni adhesion to and invasion of IECs. C. jejuni OMVs also induce IECs innate immune responses. The bile salt sodium taurocholate (ST) is sensed as a host signal to coordinate the activation of virulence-associated genes in the enteric pathogen Vibrio cholerae. In this study, the effect of ST on C. jejuni OMVs was investigated. Physiological concentrations of ST do not have an inhibitory effect on C. jejuni growth until the early stationary phase. Coculture of C. jejuni with 0.1\% or 0.2\% (w/v) ST stimulates OMV production, increasing both lipid and protein concentrations. C. jejuni ST-OMVs possess increased proteolytic activity and exhibit a different protein profile compared to OMVs isolated in the absence of ST. ST-OMVs exhibit enhanced cytotoxicity and immunogenicity to T84 IECs and enhanced killing of Galleria mellonella larvae. ST increases the level of mRNA transcripts of the OMVs-associated serine protease genes and the cdtABC operon that encodes the cytolethal distending toxin. Coculture with ST significantly enhances the OMVs-induced cleavage of E-cadherin and occludin. C. jejuni OMVs also cleave the major endoplasmic reticulum chaperone protein BiP/GRP78 and this activity is associated with the Cj1365c protease. These data suggest that C. jejuni responds to the presence of physiological concentrations of the bile salt ST that increases OMV production and the synthesis of virulence-associated factors that are secreted within the OMVs. We propose that these events contribute to pathogenesis.},

In C. jejuni NCTC11168, this pathway confers l-fucose chemotaxis and competitive colonization advantages in the piglet diarrhea model, but the catabolic steps remain unknown. Here we solved the putative dehydrogenase structure, resembling FabG of Burkholderia multivorans. The C. jejuni enzyme, FucX, reduces l-fucose and d-arabinose in vitro and both sugars are catabolized by fuc-operon encoded enzymes. This enzyme alone confers chemotaxis to both sugars in a non-carbohydrate-utilizing C. jejuni strain. Although C. jejuni lacks fucosidases, the organism exhibits enhanced growth in vitro when co-cultured with Bacteroides vulgatus, suggesting scavenging may occur. Yet, when excess amino acids are available, C. jejuni prefers them to carbohydrates, indicating a metabolic hierarchy exists.

Despite a small genome, the metabolic plasticity of C. jejuni allows proliferation in chicken ceca and mammalian host intestines, and survival in environments with a variety of temperatures, pH, osmotic conditions, and nutrient availabilities. The exact mechanism of C. jejuni infection is unknown, however, virulence requires motility. Our data suggest the C. jejuni RidA homologue, Cj1388, plays a role in flagellar biosynthesis, regulation, structure, and/or function and, as such is expected to influence virulence of the organism. Mutants lacking cj1388 have defects in motility, autoagglutination, and phage infectivity under the conditions tested. Comparison to the RidA paradigm from Salmonella enterica indicates the phenotypes of the C. jejuni cj1388 mutant are likely due to the inhibition of one or more pyridoxal 5’-phosphate-dependent enzymes by the reactive enamine 2-aminoacrylate.},

The perception cues from biotic or abiotic environments by the bacteria are often related to bacterial surface and membrane proteins that mediate the cellular response for the adaptation of Campylobacter jejuni to the environment. These proteins function rarely as a unique entity, they are often organized in functional complexes. In C. jejuni, these complexes are not fully identified and some of them remain unknown. To identify putative functional multi-subunit entities at the membrane subproteome level of C. jejuni, a holistic non a priori method was addressed using two-dimensional blue native /Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) in strain C. jejuni 81-176. Couples of acrylamide gradient/migration-time, membrane detergent concentration and hand-made strips were optimized to obtain reproducible extraction and separation of intact membrane protein complexes (MCPs). MCPs were subsequently denatured using SDS-PAGE and each spot from each MCP was identified by mass spectrometry. Altogether, 21 MPCs could be detected including multihomooligomeric and multiheteroligomeric complexes distributed in both inner and outer membranes. Function, conservation and regulation of MPCs across C. jejuni strains were inspected by functional and genomic comparison analyses. In this study, relatedness between subunits of two efflux pumps, CmeABC and MacABputC was observed. In addition, a consensus sequence CosR-binding box in promoter regions of MacABputC was identified in C. jejuni but not in C. coli. The MPCs identified in C. jejuni 81-176 membrane are involved in protein folding, molecules trafficking, oxidative phosphorylation, membrane structuration, peptidoglycan biosynthesis, motility and chemotaxis, stress signaling, efflux pumps and virulence.},

This structure is dictated by trimming of peptide stems by the LD-carboxypeptidase Pgp2 within the periplasm. The interaction interface between Pgp2 and PG to select sites for peptide trimming is unknown. We determined a 1.6 Å resolution crystal structure of Pgp2, which contains a conserved LD-carboxypeptidase domain and a previously uncharacterized domain with an NTF2-like fold (NTF2). We identified a pocket in the NTF2 domain formed by conserved residues and located ∼40 Å from the LD-carboxypeptidase active site. Expression of \textit{pgp2} in trans with substitutions of charged (Lys257, Lys307, Glu324) and hydrophobic residues (Phe242 and Tyr233) within the pocket did not restore helical morphology to a \textit{pgp2} deletion strain. Muropeptide analysis indicated a decrease of murotripeptides in the deletion strain expressing these mutants, suggesting reduced Pgp2 catalytic activity. Pgp2 but not the K307A mutant was pulled down by \textit{C. jejuni} Δ\textit{pgp2} PG sacculi, supporting a role for the pocket in PG binding. NMR spectroscopy was used to define the interaction interfaces of Pgp2 with several PG fragments, which bound to the active site within the LD-carboxypeptidase domain and the pocket of the NTF2 domain. We propose a model for Pgp2 binding to PG strands involving both the LD-carboxypeptidase domain and the accessory NTF2 domain to induce a helical cell shape.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The Gram-negative Epsilonproteobacterium Campylobacter jejuni is currently the most prevalent bacterial foodborne pathogen. Like for many other human pathogens, infection studies with C. jejuni mainly employ artificial animal or cell culture models that can be limited in their ability to reflect the in-vivo environment within the human host. Here, we report the development and application of a human three-dimensional (3D) infection model based on tissue engineering to study host-pathogen interactions. Our intestinal 3D tissue model is built on a decellularized extracellular matrix scaffold, which is reseeded with human Caco-2 cells. Dynamic culture conditions enable the formation of a polarized mucosal epithelial barrier reminiscent of the 3D microarchitecture of the human small intestine. Infection with C. jejuni demonstrates that the 3D tissue model can reveal isolate-dependent colonization and barrier disruption phenotypes accompanied by perturbed localization of cell-cell junctions. Pathogenesis-related phenotypes of C. jejuni mutant strains in the 3D model deviated from those obtained with 2D-monolayers, but recapitulated phenotypes previously observed in animal models. Moreover, we demonstrate the involvement of a small regulatory RNA pair, CJnc180/190, during infections and observe different phenotypes of CJnc180/190 mutant strains in 2D vs. 3D infection models. Hereby, the CJnc190 sRNA exerts its pathogenic influence, at least in part, via repression of PtmG, which is involved in flagellin modification. Our results suggest that the Caco-2 cell-based 3D tissue model is a valuable and biologically relevant tool between in-vitro and in-vivo infection models to study virulence of C. jejuni and other gastrointestinal pathogens.},

	abstract = {Mechanisms of host–pathogen interactions resulting in immunopathological responses upon human Campylobacter jejuni infection are not completely understood, but the recent availability of murine infection models mimicking key features of campylobacteriosis helps solving this dilemma. During a screen for proteases expressed by C. jejuni, we identified a peptidase of the M24 family as a potential novel virulence factor, which was named PepP. The gene is strongly conserved in various Campylobacter species. A constructed deletion mutant ΔpepP of C. jejuni strain 81–176 grew as efficiently compared to isogenic wild-type (WT) or pepP complemented bacteria. To shed light on the potential role of this protease in mediating immunopathological responses in the mammalian host, we perorally challenged microbiota-depleted IL-10−/- mice with these strains. All strains stably colonized the murine gastrointestinal tract with comparably high loads. Remarkably, pepP deficiency was associated with less severe induced malaise, with less distinct apoptotic and innate immune cell responses, but also with more pronounced proliferative/regenerative epithelial cell responses in the large intestine at d6post-infection. Furthermore, pro-inflammatory mediators were lower in the colon, ileum, and mesenteric lymph nodes of mice that had been challenged with the ΔpepP mutant compared to the WT or pepP complemented strains. This also held true for extra-intestinal organs including liver, kidneys, and lungs, and, strikingly, to systemic compartments. Taken together, protease PepP is a novel virulence determinant involved in mediating campylobacteriosis. The finding that apoptosis in the colon is significantly diminished in mice infected with the pepP mutant highlights the epithelial layer as the first and main target of PepP in the intestine.},

In the present study, we investigated the phospholipidome of the bacterial pathogen Campylobacter jejuni. Transcription profiling on logarithmic and stationary phase grown cells of the microaerophilic human pathogen C. jejuni using RNA-seq revealed differential expression of putative phospholipid biosynthesis genes. By applying high-performance liquid chromatography tandem–mass spectrometry, we identified 203 phospholipid species representing the first determination of the phospholipidome of this pathogen. We identified nine different phospholipid classes carrying between one and three acyl chains. Phospholipidome analysis on bacteria of different ages (0–5 days) showed rapid changes in the ratio of phospholipids containing ethanolamine, or glycerol as phospholipid head group and in the number of cyclopropane bond containing fatty acids. Oxygen concentration influenced the percentage of lysophospholipids, and cyclo-propane bonds containing acyl chains. We show that large amounts of the phospholipids are lysophospholipids (30–45\%), which mutant studies reveal are needed for normal C. jejuni motility at low oxygen conditions. C. jejuni possesses an unusual phospholipidome that is highly dynamic in response to environmental changes.},

We recently showed that the immunopathological sequelae in Campylobacter jejuni-infected mice were due to Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 dependent immune responses induced by bacterial lipooligosaccharide (LOS). Information regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying Campylobacter coli-host interactions are scarce, however. Therefore, we analyzed C. coli-induced campylobacteriosis in secondary abiotic IL-10\&minus;/\&minus; mice with and without TLR4. Mice were infected perorally with a human C. coli isolate or with a murine commensal Escherichia coli as apathogenic, non-invasive control. Independent from TLR4, C. coli and E. coli stably colonized the gastrointestinal tract, but only C. coli induced clinical signs of campylobacteriosis. TLR4\&minus;/\&minus; IL-10\&minus;/\&minus; mice, however, displayed less frequently fecal blood and less distinct histopathological and apoptotic sequelae in the colon versus IL-10\&minus;/\&minus; counterparts on day 28 following C. coli infection. Furthermore, C. coli-induced colonic immune cell responses were less pronounced in TLR4\&minus;/\&minus; IL-10\&minus;/\&minus; as compared to IL-10\&minus;/\&minus; mice and accompanied by lower pro-inflammatory mediator concentrations in the intestines and the liver of the former versus the latter. In conclusion, our study provides evidence that TLR4 is involved in mediating C. coli-LOS-induced immune responses in intestinal and extra-intestinal compartments during murine campylobacteriosis.},

Given globally emerging Campylobacter infections in humans, we addressed potential anti-pathogenic, immuno-modulatory and intestinal epithelial barrier preserving properties of synthetic resveratrol in the present preclinical intervention study applying a murine acute campylobacteriosis model. Two days following peroral C. jejuni infection, secondary abiotic IL-10\&minus;/\&minus; mice were either subjected to resveratrol or placebo via the drinking water. Whereas placebo mice suffered from acute enterocolitis at day 6 post-infection, resveratrol treatment did not only lead to improved clinical conditions, but also to less pronounced colonic epithelial apoptosis as compared to placebo application. Furthermore, C. jejuni induced innate and adaptive immune cell responses were dampened in the large intestines upon resveratrol challenge and accompanied by less colonic nitric oxide secretion in the resveratrol versus the placebo cohort. Functional analyses revealed that resveratrol treatment could effectively rescue colonic epithelial barrier function in C. jejuni infected mice. Strikingly, the disease-alleviating effects of resveratrol could additionally be found in extra-intestinal and also systemic compartments at day 6 post-infection. For the first time, our current preclinical intervention study provides evidence that peroral resveratrol treatment exerts potent disease-alleviating effects during acute experimental campylobacteriosis.},

Therefore, secondary abiotic IL-10\&minus;/\&minus; mice were perorally infected with C. jejuni and intraperitoneally treated with synthetic NAP from day 2 until day 5 post-infection. NAP-treatment did not affect gastrointestinal C. jejuni colonization but could alleviate clinical signs of infection that was accompanied by less pronounced apoptosis of colonic epithelial cells and enhancement of cell regenerative measures on day 6 post-infection. Moreover, NAP-treatment resulted in less distinct innate and adaptive pro-inflammatory immune responses that were not restricted to the intestinal tract but could also be observed in extra-intestinal and even systemic compartments. NAP-treatment further resulted in less frequent translocation of viable pathogens from the intestinal tract to extra-intestinal including systemic tissue sites.

Moreover, C. jejuni infection can trigger the polyneuropathic disorder denominated Guillain-Barr\&eacute; syndrome (GBS). The C. jejuni strains that can elicit GBS carry either wlaN or cgtB, coding both genes for a \&beta;-1,3-galactosyltransferase enzyme that is required for the production of sialylated lipooligosaccharide (LOSSIAL). We described a differential prevalence of the genes wlaN and cgtB in C. jejuni isolates from three different ecological niches: humans, broiler chickens, and wild birds. The distribution of both genes, which is similar between broiler chicken and human isolates and distinct when compared to the wild bird isolates, suggests a host-dependent distribution. Moreover, the prevalence of the wlaN and cgtB genes seems to be restricted to some clonal complexes. Gene sequencing identified the presence of new variants of the G- homopolymeric tract within the wlaN gene. Furthermore, we detected two variants of a G rich region within the cgtB gene, suggesting that, similarly to wlaN, the G-tract in the cgtB gene mediates the phase variation control of cgtB expression. Caco-2 cell invasion assays indicate that there is no evident correlation between the production of LOSSIAL and the ability to invade eukaryotic cells.},

Here we examine the distribution and conservation of known and putative SSR-driven phase variable genes - the phasome - in the genus Campylobacter. PhasomeIt, a new program, was specifically designed for rapid identification of SSR-mediated PV. This program detects the location, type and repeat number of every SSR. Each SSR is linked to a specific gene and its putative expression state. Other outputs include conservation of SSR-driven phase-variable genes and the 'core phasome' - the minimal set of PV genes in a phylogenetic grouping. Analysis of 77 complete Campylobacter genome sequences detected a 'core phasome' of conserved PV genes in each species and a large number of rare PV genes with few, or no, homologues in other genome sequences. Analysis of a set of partial genome sequences, with food-chain-associated metadata, detected evidence of a weak link between phasome and source host for disease-causing isolates of sequence type (ST)-828 but not the ST-21 or ST-45 complexes. Investigation of the phasomes in the genus Campylobacter provided evidence of overlapping but distinctive mechanisms of PV-mediated adaptation to specific niches. This suggests that the phasome could be involved in host adaptation and spread of campylobacters. Finally, this tool is malleable and will have utility for studying the distribution and genic effects of other repetitive elements in diverse bacterial species.},

	abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major public health problem that requires publicly available tools for rapid analysis. To identify AMR genes in whole-genome sequences, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) has produced AMRFinder, a tool that identifies AMR genes using a high-quality curated AMR gene reference database. The Bacterial Antimicrobial Resistance Reference Gene Database consists of up-to-date gene nomenclature, a set of hidden Markov models (HMMs), and a curated protein family hierarchy. Currently, it contains 4,579 antimicrobial resistance proteins and more than 560 HMMs. Here, we describe AMRFinder and its associated database. To assess the predictive ability of AMRFinder, we measured the consistency between predicted AMR genotypes from AMRFinder and resistance phenotypes of 6,242 isolates from the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS). This included 5,425 Salmonella enterica, 770 Campylobacter spp., and 47 Escherichia coli isolates phenotypically tested against various antimicrobial agents. Of 87,679 susceptibility tests performed, 98.4\% were consistent with predictions. To assess the accuracy of AMRFinder, we compared its gene symbol output with that of a 2017 version of ResFinder, another publicly available resistance gene detection system. Most gene calls were identical, but there were 1,229 gene symbol differences (8.8\%) between them, with differences due to both algorithmic differences and database composition. AMRFinder missed 16 loci that ResFinder found, while ResFinder missed 216 loci that AMRFinder identified. Based on these results, AMRFinder appears to be a highly accurate AMR gene detection system.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: WGS-based antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) is as reliable as phenotypic AST for several antimicrobial/bacterial species combinations. However, routine use of WGS-based AST is hindered by the need for bioinformatics skills and knowledge of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinants to operate the vast majority of tools developed to date. By leveraging on ResFinder and PointFinder, two freely accessible tools that can also assist users without bioinformatics skills, we aimed at increasing their speed and providing an easily interpretable antibiogram as output.
METHODS: The ResFinder code was re-written to process raw reads and use Kmer-based alignment. The existing ResFinder and PointFinder databases were revised and expanded. Additional databases were developed including a genotype-to-phenotype key associating each AMR determinant with a phenotype at the antimicrobial compound level, and species-specific panels for in silico antibiograms. ResFinder 4.0 was validated using Escherichia coli (n = 584), Salmonella spp. (n = 1081), Campylobacter jejuni (n = 239), Enterococcus faecium (n = 106), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 50) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 163) exhibiting different AST profiles, and from different human and animal sources and geographical origins.
RESULTS: Genotype-phenotype concordance was ≥95\% for 46/51 and 25/32 of the antimicrobial/species combinations evaluated for Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, respectively. When genotype-phenotype concordance was {\textless}95\%, discrepancies were mainly linked to criteria for interpretation of phenotypic tests and suboptimal sequence quality, and not to ResFinder 4.0 performance.
CONCLUSIONS: WGS-based AST using ResFinder 4.0 provides in silico antibiograms as reliable as those obtained by phenotypic AST at least for the bacterial species/antimicrobial agents of major public health relevance considered.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Campylobacteriosis is among the world’s most common foodborne illnesses, caused predominantly by the bacterium Campylobacter jejuni . Effective interventions require determination of the infection source which is challenging as transmission occurs via multiple sources such as contaminated meat, poultry, and drinking water. Strain variation has allowed source tracking based upon allelic variation in multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) genes allowing isolates from infected individuals to be attributed to specific animal or environmental reservoirs. However, the accuracy of probabilistic attribution models has been limited by the ability to differentiate isolates based upon just 7 MLST genes. Here, we broaden the input data spectrum to include core genome MLST (cgMLST) and whole genome sequences (WGS), and implement multiple machine learning algorithms, allowing more accurate source attribution. We increase attribution accuracy from 64\% using the standard iSource population genetic approach to 71\% for MLST, 85\% for cgMLST and 78\% for kmerized WGS data using machine learning. To gain insight beyond the source model prediction, we use Bayesian inference to analyse the relative affinity of C. jejuni strains to infect humans and identified potential differences, in source-human transmission ability among clonally related isolates in the most common disease causing lineage (ST-21 clonal complex). Providing generalizable computationally efficient methods, based upon machine learning and population genetics, we provide a scalable approach to global disease surveillance that can continuously incorporate novel samples for source attribution and identify fine-scale variation in transmission potential.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Campylobacter is among the most common causes of gastroenteritis worldwide. Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli are the most common species causing human disease. DNA sequence-based methods for strain characterization have focused largely on C. jejuni, responsible for 80 to 90\% of infections, meaning that C. coli epidemiology has lagged behind. Here, we have analyzed the genome of 450 C. coli isolates to determine genetic markers that can discriminate isolates sampled from 3 major reservoir hosts (chickens, cattle, and pigs). These markers then were applied to identify the source of infection of 147 C. coli strains from French clinical cases. Using STRUCTURE software, 259 potential host-segregating markers were revealed by probabilistic characterization of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) frequency variation in strain collections from three different hosts. These SNPs were found in 41 genes or intergenic regions, mostly coding for proteins involved in motility and membrane functions. Source attribution of clinical isolates based on the differential presence of these markers confirmed chickens as the most common source of C. coli infection in France.
IMPORTANCE Genome-wide and source attribution studies based on Campylobacter species have shown their importance for the understanding of foodborne infections. Although the use of multilocus sequence typing based on 7 genes from C. jejuni is a powerful method to structure populations, when applied to C. coli, results have not clearly demonstrated its robustness. Therefore, we aim to provide more accurate data based on the identification of single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Results from this study reveal an important number of host-segregating SNPs, found in proteins involved in motility, membrane functions, or DNA repair systems. These findings offer new, interesting opportunities for further study of C. coli adaptation to its environment. Additionally, the results demonstrate that poultry is potentially the main reservoir of C. coli in France.},

Public Health England received 25 isolates of Campylobacter jejuni from an individual with combined variable immunodeficiency over a period of 15 years. All isolates were typed and archived at the time of receipt. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were performed to examine the relatedness of the isolates and to investigate the changes in the genome that had taken place over the course of the infection. Genomic typing methods were compared to conventional phenotypic methods, and revealed that the infection was caused by a single, persistent strain of C. jejuni belonging to clonal complex ST-45, with evidence of adaptation and selection in the genome over the course of the infection. Genomic analysis of sequence variants associated with antimicrobial resistance identified the genetic background behind rRNA gene mutations causing variable levels of resistance to erythromycin. This application of WGS to examine a persistent case of campylobacteriosis provides insight into the mutations and selective pressures occurring over the course of an infection, some of which have important clinical relevance.},

This included detailed genomic molecular epidemiology of Campylobacter for 2019. For February-December 2019, 24 clinical microbiology laboratories in Ireland submitted all PCR/culture-positive clinical Campylobacter spp. specimens to Public Health Laboratory (PHL) Dublin one week out of every four. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) according to European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) criteria was carried out for Campylobacter spp. isolates for ciprofloxacin, tetracycline and erythromycin. Batch whole genome sequencing (WGS) was carried out on cultures and analysis was performed to determine species, genotype, identify antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and virulence determinants and identify clusters. A total of 75 isolates and 366 PCR-positive stools were received, and 277 isolates recovered (55.7\% recovery from stools). Of 257 isolates characterized by WGS, 86.4\% (n = 222) were Campylobacter jejuni, 11.7\% (n = 30) Campylobacter coli and 1.9\% (n = 5) Campylobacter lari. There were 20 clonal complexes with ST-21 clonal complex most prevalent at 26.8\% (n = 69). 50.5\% (n = 140) of isolates were susceptible to all three antimicrobials tested. 39.3\% (n = 109) isolates were ciprofloxacin resistant, 26.3\% (n = 73) tetracycline resistant and two isolates erythromycin resistant. Congruence between phenotypic and genotypic AST was observed. There was 95.9\% and 95.6\% sensitivity and specificity for WGS to predict ciprofloxacin sensitivity and 98.6\% and 99.5\% sensitivity and specificity for WGS to predict tetracycline sensitivity. Virulence factors flaA, racR, ciaB and cdtB were detected in all isolates. WGS identified 31 potential clusters for public health alert. This sentinel surveillance of human campylobacteriosis in Ireland establishes the basis for a national reference service. Linking with other partners in a 'One Health' framework will help us better understand sources of infection to reduce disease burden and the threat of AMR.},

Here, we validated a novel framework to define infection mechanism using the combination of GWAS, machine learning, and bacterial population genomics that ranked allelic variants that accurately identified disease. This approach parsed a dataset of 1.2 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and indels that resulted in an importance ranked list of associated alleles of porA in Campylobacter jejuni using spatiotemporal analysis over 30 years. We validated this approach using previously proven laboratory experimental alleles from an in vivo guinea pig abortion model. This framework, termed \&mu;PathML, defined intestinal and extraintestinal groups that have differential allelic porA variants that cause abortion. Divergent variants containing indels that defeated automated annotation were rescued using biological context and knowledge that resulted in defining rare, divergent variants that were maintained in the population over two continents and 30 years. This study defines the capability of machine learning coupled with GWAS and population genomics to simultaneously identify and rank alleles to define their role in infectious disease mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Campylobacter jejuni is a widespread zoonotic pathogen and the leading bacterial cause of foodborne gastroenteritis in humans. Previous infection studies showed disruption of intercellular contacts, induction of epithelial apoptosis, and immune activation, all three contributing to intestinal barrier dysfunction leading to diarrhea. The present study aims to determine the impact of subepithelial immune cells on intestinal barrier dysfunction during Campylobacter jejuni infection and the underlying pathological mechanisms. Infection was performed in a co-culture of confluent monolayers of the human colon cell line HT-29/B6-GR/MR and THP-1 immune cells. Twenty-two hours after infection, transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) was decreased by 58±6\% compared to controls. The infection resulted in an increase in permeability for fluorescein (332 Da; 4.5-fold) and for FITC-dextran (4 kDa; 3.5-fold), respectively. In contrast, incubation of the co-culture with the pan-caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh during the infection resulted in a complete recovery of the decrease in TER and an increase in flux values. Fluorescence microscopy showed apoptotic fragmentation in infected cell monolayers resulting in a 5-fold increase of the apoptotic ratio, accompanied by an increased caspase-3 cleavage and caspase-3/7 activity, which both were not present after Q-VD-OPh treatment. Western blot analysis revealed increased claudin-1 and claudin-2 protein expression. Inhibition of apoptosis induction did not normalize these tight junction changes. TNFα concentration was increased during the infection in the co-culture. In conclusion, Campylobacter jejuni infection and the consequent subepithelial immune activation cause intestinal barrier dysfunction mainly through caspase-3-dependent epithelial apoptosis. Concomitant tight junction changes were caspase-independent. Anti-apoptotic and immune-modulatory substances appear to be promising agents for treatment of campylobacteriosis.},

            Background
            Campylobacter jejuni
            is the leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in humans and the handling or consumption of contaminated poultry meat is a key source of infection. Selective breeding of poultry that exhibit elevated resistance to
            Campylobacter
            is an attractive control strategy. Here we studied the global transcriptional response of inbred chicken lines that differ in resistance to
            C. jejuni
            colonisation at a key site of bacterial persistence.
Results

Three-week-old chickens of line 6
            1
            and N were inoculated orally with
            C. jejuni
            strain M1 and caecal contents and tonsils were sampled at 1 and 5 days post-infection. Caecal colonisation was significantly lower in line 6
            1
            compared to line N at 1 day post-infection, but not 5 days post-infection. RNA-Seq analysis of caecal tonsils of both lines revealed a limited response to
            C. jejuni
            infection compared to age-matched uninfected controls. In line N at days 1 and 5 post-infection, just 8 and 3 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected (fold-change {\textgreater} 2 and false-discovery rate of {\textless} 0.05) relative to uninfected controls, respectively. In the relatively resistant line 6
            1
            , a broader response to
            C. jejuni
            was observed, with 69 DEGs relating to immune regulation, cell signalling and metabolism at 1 day post-infection. However, by day 5 post-infection, no DEGs were detected. By far, the greatest number of DEGs were between uninfected birds of the two lines implying that differential resistance to
            C. jejuni
            is intrinsic. Of these genes, several Major Histocompatibility Complex class I-related genes (

	abstract = {Campylobacter spp. are among the microorganisms most commonly associated with foodborne disease. Swine are known to be the main reservoir of Campylobacter coli and a possible source infection of humans as a result of carcass contamination at slaughter. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of C. coli contamination in swine carcasses, the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns of isolates and the genetic diversity between strains obtained from swine and those isolated from humans. The prevalence of contamination was higher on carcasses (50.4\%) than in faeces (32.9\%). The 162 C. coli isolated from swine were examined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). The results of PFGE indicated a high genetic diversity among the isolates, with 25 different PFGE types. MLST assigned 51 sequence types (STs) to isolates. The most common genotype was ST-854 (16.04\%), ST-9264 (10.49 \%) and ST-1016 (6.08 \%). Results of AMR showed a high resistance to quinolones and fluoroquinolones together with aminoglycosides and tetracycline. Many strains were multi-resistant with predominant R-type TeSCipNa (57\%). Five resistance genes were detected along with mutation in the gyrA gene. A strong correlation between phenotypic and genotypic resistance was found for fluoroquinolone and tetracycline. Genetic profiles obtained in swine isolates were compared to those of 11 human strains. All human strains and 64.19\% of animal strains (104/162) were assigned to the ST-828 clonal complex.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The lateral transfer of genes among bacterial strains and species has opposing effects, conferring potentially beneficial adaptations whilst introducing disharmony in coadapted genomes. The prevailing outcome will depend upon the fitness cost of disrupting established epistatic interactions between genes. It is challenging to understand this in nature because it requires population-scale analysis of recombination and genomic coadaptation, and laboratory confirmation of the functional significance of genotype variation. By assigning the ancestry of DNA in the genomes of two species of the world9s most common enteric bacterial pathogen, we show that up to 28\% of the Campylobacter coli genome has been recently introgressed from Campylobacter jejuni. Then, by quantifying covariation across the genome we show that \&gt;83\% of putative epistatic links are between introgressed C. jejuni genes in divergent genomic positions (\&gt;20kb apart), consistent with independent acquisition. Much of this covariation is between 16 genes, with just 5 genes accounting for 99\% of epistatic SNP pairs. Laboratory mutagenesis and complementation cloning assays demonstrated functional links between these genes, specifically related to formate dehydrogenase (FDH) activity. These findings suggest that the genetic confederations that define genomic species may be transient. Even for complex traits such as central metabolism in the bacterial cell, conditions can arise where epistatic genes can be decoupled, transferred and reinstated in a new genetic background.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

It also been reported that not only poultry, but also wild birds, are capable of carrying C. jejuni, thus demonstrating to be a risk of spreading the bacteria in the environment. To gain insight into the population structure and investigate the antimicrobial resistance genotypes and phenotypes, we analyzed a collection of 135 C.jejuni from 15 species of wild birds in Italy. MLST revealed the presence of 41 sequence types (STs) and 13 clonal complexes (CCs). ST-179 complex and the generalist ST-45 complex were the most prevalent. Core genome MLST revealed that C.jejuni from ST-45 complex clustered according to the bird species, unlike the ST-179 complex which featured 3 different species in the same cluster. Overall we found a moderate prevalence of resistance to tetracycline (12.5\%), ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid (10\%). The novel ST isolated from one pigeon showed resistance to all the antibiotics tested. The ST-179 complex (33.3\%) was identiﬁed with signiﬁcantly higher nalidixic acid resistance relative to other tested STs. Nine AMR genes (tet(O), cmeA, cmeB, cmeC, cmeR, aad, blaOXA-61, blaOXA-184 and erm(B)) and 23S rRNA and gyrA-associated point mutations were also described, indicating a concordance level between genotypic and phenotypic resistance of 23.3\%, 23.4\% and of 37.5\% for streptomycin, tetracycline and quinolones/fluoroquinolones, respectively. We recommend that particular attention should be given to wild birds as key sentinel animals for the ecosystem contamination surveillance.},

	abstract = {The present study investigated the genomic constitution and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) of 238 Campylobacter from pigs and wild boars in Italy between 2012 and 2019. Campylobacter strains were genotyped using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and whole genome MLST (wgMLST), screened for antimicrobial resistance genes, and tested for phenotypic susceptibility to six different antibiotics. C. coli was detected in 98.31\% and 91.66\% of pigs and wild boars, while C. jejuni was isolated in the remaining cases. MLST assigned 73 STs and 13 STs in pigs and wild boars, respectively, including 44 novel STs. The predominant ST in pigs was ST-854 (12.36\%), followed by ST-9264 (6.18\%). ST-1055 and ST-1417 were predominant in wild boars (30\% and 13.33\%, respectively). The minimum spanning tree using 1,121 global MLST profiles showed specific Italian clusters and a clear separation between pig and wild boar profiles. The wgMLST confirmed the MLST clustering and revealed a high genetic diversity within C. coli population in Italy. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of six antibiotics revealed higher resistance in pigs to ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, streptomycin and tetracycline, compared to wild boar. In contrast, most strains were susceptible to gentamicin. Worrying levels of multidrug resistance (MDR) were observed mostly in pig isolates. Molecular screening of AMR mechanisms revealed the predominance of gyrA T86I substitution among fluoroquinolone- and quinolone-resistant isolates, and the 23S rRNA A2075G mutation among macrolide-resistant isolates. Other resistance determinants were observed: (i) tet(O) gene was present among tetracycline-resistant isolates; (ii) rpsL and aph(3')-III genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides, were identified only in streptomycin or gentamicin-resistant pig isolates; (iii) cmeA, cmeB, cmeC, cmeR genes responsible of pump efflux mechanisms, were observed in almost all the strains; (iv) OXA-61, encoding β-lactamase, was found in the half of the strains. Genotypic and phenotypic AMR profiling was fairly correlated for quinolones/fluoroquinolones. Campylobacter infection is common also in wild boar populations in Italy, suggesting that wild boars could be a reservoir of resistant and multi-resistant Campylobacter species, which may be of public health concern.

Changes to host ecology have a major impact on the microbiota, potentially increasing the risk of zoonotic pathogens being transmitted to humans, but the impact of intensive livestock production on host-associated bacteria has rarely been studied. Here, we use large isolate collections and comparative genomics techniques, linked to phenotype studies, to understand the timescale and genomic adaptations associated with the proliferation of the most common food-born bacterial pathogen (Campylobacter jejuni) in the most prolific agricultural mammal (cattle). Our findings reveal the emergence of cattle specialist C. jejuni lineages from a background of host generalist strains that coincided with the dramatic rise in cattle numbers in the 20th century. Cattle adaptation was associated with horizontal gene transfer and significant gene gain and loss. This may be related to differences in host diet, anatomy, and physiology, leading to the proliferation of globally disseminated cattle specialists of major public health importance. This work highlights how genomic plasticity can allow important zoonotic pathogens to exploit altered niches in the face of anthropogenic change and provides information for mitigating some of the risks posed by modern agricultural systems.},

	abstract = {Campylobacter hyointestinalis is an emerging pathogen currently divided in two subspecies: C. hyointestinalis subsp. lawsonii which is predominantly recovered from pigs, and C. hyointestinalis subsp. hyointestinalis which can be found in a much wider range of mammalian hosts. Despite C. hyointestinalis being reported as an emerging pathogen, its evolutionary and host-associated diversification patterns are still vastly unexplored. For this reason, we generated whole-genome sequences of 13 C. hyointestinalis subsp. hyointestinalis strains and performed a comprehensive comparative analysis including publicly available C. hyointestinalis subsp. hyointestinalis and C. hyointestinalis subsp. lawsonii genomes, to gain insight into the genomic variation of these differentially-adapted subspecies. Both subspecies are distinct phylogenetic lineages which present an apparent barrier to homologous recombination, suggesting genetic isolation. This is further supported by accessory gene patterns that recapitulate the core genome phylogeny. Additionally, C. hyointestinalis subsp. hyointestinalis presents a bigger and more diverse accessory genome, which probably reflects its capacity to colonize different mammalian hosts unlike C. hyointestinalis subsp. lawsonii that is presumably host-restricted. This greater plasticity in the accessory genome of C. hyointestinalis subsp. hyointestinalis correlates to a higher incidence of genome-wide recombination events, that may be the underlying mechanism driving its diversification. Concordantly, both subspecies present distinct patterns of gene families involved in genome plasticity and DNA repair like CRISPR-associated proteins and restriction-modification systems. Together, our results provide an overview of the genetic mechanisms shaping the genomes of C. hyointestinalis subspecies, contributing to understand the biology of Campylobacter species that are increasingly recognized as emerging pathogens.},

While C. jejuni colonises many wild animals and livestock, persistence mechanisms enabling the bacterium to adapt to host species9 guts are not fully understood. In order to identify putative determinants influencing host preferences of distinct lineages, bootstrapping based on stratified random sampling combined with a k-mer-based genome-wide association was conducted on 490 genomes from diverse origins in Germany and Canada. We show a strong association of both the core and the accessory genome characteristics with distinct host animal species, indicating multiple adaptive trajectories defining the evolution of C. jejuni lifestyle preferences in different ecosystems. Here, we demonstrate that adaptation towards a specific host niche ecology is most likely a long evolutionary and multifactorial process, expressed by gene absence or presence and allele variations of core genes. Several host-specific allelic variants from different phylogenetic backgrounds, including dnaE, rpoB, ftsX or pycB play important roles for genome maintenance and metabolic pathways. Thus, variants of genes important for C. jejuni to cope with specific ecological niches or hosts may be useful markers for both surveillance and future pathogen intervention strategies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Abstract{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Measuring molecular evolution in bacteria typically requires estimation of the rate at which mutations accumulate in strains sampled at different times that share a common ancestor. This approach has been useful for dating ecological and evolutionary events that coincide with the emergence of important lineages, such as outbreak strains and obligate human pathogens. However, in multi-host (niche) transmission scenarios, where the pathogen is essentially an opportunistic environmental organism, sampling is often sporadic and rarely reflects the overall population, particularly when concentrated on clinical isolates. This means that approaches that assume recent common ancestry are not applicable. Here we present a new approach to estimate the molecular clock rate in \textit{Campylobacter} that draws on the popular probability conundrum known as the ‘birthday problem’. Using large genomic datasets and comparative genomic approaches, we identify isolate pairs where common ancestry is inferred within the sample time-frame – analogous to a shared birthday. Identifying synonymous and non-synonymous substitions, both within and outside of recombinant regions of the genome, we quantify clock-like diversification to estimate mutation rates for the common pathogenic species \textit{Campylobacter coli} (2.4 × 10$^{\textrm{-6}}$ s/s/y) and \textit{Campylobacter jejuni} (3.4 × 10$^{\textrm{-6}}$ s/s/y). Finally, using estimated mutation rates we assess the rate of turnover of lineages in our sample set over short evolutionary timescales. This provides a generalizable approach to calibrating mutation rates in populations of environmental bacteria and shows that multiple lineages are maintained, implying that large-scale clonal sweeps may take hundreds of years or more in these species.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

These VBNC bacterial cells retain metabolism and demonstrate pathogenic potential due to their ability to resuscitate under favorable conditions. Rapid and accurate determination of VBNC Campylobacter is critical to further understand the induction and resuscitation of dormancy state of this microbe in the agri-food system. Here, we integrated propidium monoazide (PMA) with real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) targeting the rpoB gene to detect and quantify C. jejuni in the VBNC state. First, we optimized the concentration of PMA (20 µM) that could significantly inhibit the amplification of dead cells by qPCR with no significant interference on the amplification of viable cell DNA. PMA-qPCR was highly specific to C. jejuni with a limit of detection (LOD) of 2.43 log CFU/mL in pure bacterial culture. A standard curve for C. jejuni cell concentrations was established with the correlation coefficient of 0.9999 at the linear range of 3.43 to 8.43 log CFU/mL. Induction of C. jejuni into the VBNC state by osmotic stress (i.e., 7\% NaCl) was rapid (10\% population). The LOD of PMA-qPCR for VBNC C. jejuni exogenously applied to chicken breasts was 3.12 log CFU/g. In conclusion, PMA-qPCR is a rapid, specific and sensitive method for the detection and quantification of VBNC C. jejuni in poultry products. This technique can give insight into the prevalence of VBNC Campylobacter in the environment and agri-food production system.},

	abstract = {Flagellar motility plays a central role in the bacterial foodborne pathogen Campylobacter jejuni, as flagellar motility is required for reaching the intestinal epithelium and subsequent colonisation or disease. Flagellar proteins also contribute strongly to biofilm formation during transmission. Chemotaxis is the process directing flagellar motility in response to attractant and repellent stimuli, but its role in biofilm formation of C. jejuni is not well understood. Here we show that inactivation of the core chemotaxis genes cheVAWY in C. jejuni strain NCTC 11168 affects both chemotactic motility and biofilm formation. Inactivation of any of the core chemotaxis genes (cheA, cheY, cheV or cheW) impaired chemotactic motility but did not affect flagellar assembly or growth. The ∆cheY mutant swam in clockwise loops, while complementation restored normal motility. Inactivation of the core chemotaxis genes interfered with the ability to form a discrete biofilm at the air-media interface, and the ∆cheY mutant displayed reduced dispersal/shedding of bacteria into the planktonic fraction. This suggests that while the chemotaxis system is not required for biofilm formation per se, it is necessary for organized biofilm formation. Hence interference with the Campylobacter chemotaxis system at any level disrupts optimal chemotactic motility and transmission modes such as biofilm formation.},

	abstract = {Abstract Campylobacter spp. are one of the most important food-borne pathogens, which are quite susceptible to environmental or technological stressors compared to other zoonotic bacteria. This might be due to the lack of many stress response mechanisms described in other bacteria. Nevertheless, Campylobacter is able to survive in the environment and food products. Although some aspects of the heat stress response in Campylobacter (C.) jejuni are already known, information about the stress response in other Campylobacter species are still scarce. In this study, the stress response of C. coli and C. lari to elevated temperatures (46°C) was investigated by survival assays and whole transcriptome analysis. None of the strains survived at 46°C for more than 8 hours and approx. 20 \% of the genes of C. coli RM2228 and C. lari RM2100 were differentially expressed. The transcriptomic profiles showed enhanced gene expression of several chaperones like dnaK, groES, groEL and clpB in both strains, indicating a general involvement in the heat stress response within the Campylobacter species. However, the pronounced differences in the expression pattern between C. coli and C. lari suggest that stress response mechanisms described for one Campylobacter species might be not necessarily transferable to other Campylobacter species.},

              Streptococcus pyogenes
              (SpyCas9) is more suitable for guide-dependent editing. However, in human cells, native SpyCas9 may still cause some DNA damage, most likely because of its ssDNA cleavage activity. This side effect can be completely prevented by saturation of SpyCas9 with an appropriate guide RNA, which is only partially effective for CjeCas9. We conclude that CjeCas9 plays an active role in attacking human cells rather than in viral defense. Moreover, these unique catalytic features may therefore make CjeCas9 less suitable for genome editing applications.},

              Bacterial flagella are reversible rotary motors that rotate external filaments for bacterial propulsion. Some flagellar motors have diversified by recruiting additional components that influence torque and rotation, but little is known about the possible diversification and evolution of core motor components. The mechanistic core of flagella is the cytoplasmic C ring, which functions as a rotor, directional switch, and assembly platform for the flagellar type III secretion system (fT3SS) ATPase. The C ring is composed of a ring of FliG proteins and a helical ring of surface presentation of antigen (SPOA) domains from the switch proteins FliM and one of two usually mutually exclusive paralogs, FliN or FliY. We investigated the composition, architecture, and function of the C ring of
              Campylobacter jejuni
              , which encodes FliG, FliM, and both FliY and FliN by a variety of interrogative approaches. We discovered a diversified
              C. jejuni
              C ring containing FliG, FliM, and both FliY, which functions as a classical FliN-like protein for flagellar assembly, and FliN, which has neofunctionalized into a structural role. Specific protein interactions drive the formation of a more complex heterooligomeric
              C. jejuni
              C-ring structure. We discovered that this complex C ring has additional cellular functions in polarly localizing FlhG for numerical regulation of flagellar biogenesis and spatial regulation of division. Furthermore, mutation of the
              C. jejuni
              C ring revealed a T3SS that was less dependent on its ATPase complex for assembly than were other systems. Our results highlight considerable evolved flagellar diversity that impacts motor output, biogenesis, and cellular processes in different species.
            
            
              IMPORTANCE
              The conserved core of bacterial flagellar motors reflects a shared evolutionary history that preserves the mechanisms essential for flagellar assembly, rotation, and directional switching. In this work, we describe an expanded and diversified set of core components in the
              Campylobacter jejuni
              flagellar C ring, the mechanistic core of the motor. Our work provides insight into how usually conserved core components may have diversified by gene duplication, enabling a division of labor of the ancestral protein between the two new proteins, acquisition of new roles in flagellar assembly and motility, and expansion of the function of the flagellum beyond motility, including spatial regulation of cell division and numerical control of flagellar biogenesis in
              C. jejuni
              . Our results highlight that relatively small changes, such as gene duplications, can have substantial ramifications on the cellular roles of a molecular machine.},

	abstract = {Vertebrates, from zebra fish to humans, have an innate immune recognition of many bacterial flagellins. This involves a conserved eight-amino acid epitope in flagellin recognized by the Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5). Several important human pathogens, such as Helicobacter pylori and Campylobacter jejuni, have escaped TLR5 activation by mutations in this epitope. When such mutations were introduced into Salmonella flagellin, motility was abolished. It was previously argued, using very low-resolution cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), that C. jejuni accommodated these mutations by forming filaments with 7 protofilaments, rather than the 11 found in other bacteria. We have now determined the atomic structure of the C. jejuni G508A flagellar filament from a 3.5-Å-resolution cryo-EM reconstruction, and show that it has 11 protofilaments. The residues in the C. jejuni TLR5 epitope have reduced contacts with the adjacent subunit compared to other bacterial flagellar filament structures. The weakening of the subunit−subunit interface introduced by the mutations in the TLR5 epitope is compensated for by extensive interactions between the outer domains of the flagellin subunits. In other bacteria, these outer domains can be nearly absent or removed without affecting motility. Furthermore, we provide evidence for the stabilization of these outer domain interactions through glycosylation of key residues. These results explain the essential role of glycosylation in C. jejuni motility, and show how the outer domains have evolved to play a role not previously found in other bacteria.},
